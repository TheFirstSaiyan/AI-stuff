It wrote Arguably content is the most overused but misunderstood buzzword in contemporary marketing.
Its become a catchall term that alludes to everything and nothing and on its own is too woolly and lofty to hold all the complexities that are contained within.Suffice to say content is everywhere everything is content  text image audio video graphic GIF emoji and all else in between.
Content is what Campaign UK calls the cornerstone of branding and marketing publishing and PR SEO and social media.
Several marketing strategists want the overused  and even abused  term to disappear but content factories continue to be churned out by the hour.Pepper one such content factory that was birthed in the hostel rooms of BITS Pilani in 2017 aims to be different though.
Four engineers  Anirudh Singla Adit Mittal Rishabh Shekhar and Parv Panthari  in their sophomore year formed this startup to produce content for a variety of commercial purposes and most importantly serve as a mediation platform that connects talented writers to organisations that require content.
L to R Adit Mittal Parv Panthari Anirudh Singla and Rishabh Shekhar Cofounders PepperPepper focuses on written content that includes blogs press releases corporate website information social media campaigns and more.
In about a year it has onboarded over 50 brands and is hitting 900 to 950 pieces a month.
It has created a network of about 80 writers five inhouse whose skills are matched with available opportunities in the content industry.
The startup has just secured an order of 10000 content pieces from an industrial group which it has to deliver in nine months.It soon plans to start creating visual content.
All this even as its four founders continue to be fulltime students at BITS Pilani.So what led to Pepper Was one more content factory really requiredAnirudh Singla Founder  CEO Pepper tells YourStory All businesses are finetuning their content marketing strategies.
Companies heavily invest in content when they raise rounds.
But they have to deal with multiple stakeholders and their inhouse teams cannot satiate this demand.
There are hassles in content production and it takes away a lot of resources money and time from companies.
We step in to ensure that we handle all aspects of content generation from strategy to detailed execution.The opportunity in contentAnirudh stresses on the big opportunity that is content marketing.
And the numbers back him up.
Content marketing is estimated to be a 313 billion global industry by 2019 according to PQ Media.
Content is the currency of digital marketing says Anirudh yet over 80 percent of businesses havent formalised the way they produce content.
Hence there is a lot of scope to create good value in this industry.
While Peppers model is not unique given there have been similar content marketplaces like Contentmart White Panda WriterAccess and others it wants to differentiate itself by paying writers well and using their skills to the fullest.
Contentmart incidentally shut down this month.Pepper claims it is empowering writers who tend to be overlooked in the content creation process.As a resultwritersoften churn out content that is poor or plagiarised or both.
Anirudh explains Writers have simply become a tool in the entire process where their services arent recognised and there is huge pay disparity.
We are trying to equalise opportunities for writers wherein once they come to our platform through means of merit we take the onus of matching them with the best projects and providing them a good pay.As a result Pepper has been able to retain good writers it claims.Writers join the Pepper Cloud.
This onestop platform is where clients upload projects and writers are matched to them depending on their skill sets.
It used to be a manual process but as Peppers writer network expands the startupplans to begin using machine learning ML algorithms to sift through client projects and assign them to the bestsuited writers.
The MLpowered platform goes live at the end of September.Pepper is tweaking its platform to send periodic feedback to writers both qualitative and quantitative reviews and ratings based on client engagement Anirudh reveals.Clients and operationsOne of Peppers first big clients was WittyFeed a homegrown viral content company which crossed 50 million site visits in 2016.
It came on board in December 2017 and Anirudh and his team created mostly lifestyle content for WittyFeed.
By February 2018 Pepper had onboarded more clients  Bewakoof Zivame Times Internets Speaking Tree MeraEvents SocialCops Imarticus Learning Sportskeeda and others.Between April and August the startup claims to have witnessed exponential growth in orders.
Anirudh says We were creating 150200 pieces a month until four months ago.
Now we are at 900950.Revenues have improved too.
Bootstrapped Pepper says it is generating more than Rs 10 lakh now and aims to end the year with Rs 2025 lakh.
There are not a lot of expenses from our side.
Our basic requirements are covered in campus.
So we have been able to grow profits by 3040 percent Anirudh states.
Pepper customers seem content with its reliable services.
Parul Purwar Senior Manager  Growth  Strategy Zivame says We have been engaged with Pepper for over a month now.
Both in terms of deliverance and handling the entire project Pepper has been a reliable company to partner with.Sohail Merchant AVP  Digital Imarticus Learning says Our collaboration with Pepper has strengthened over time with them providing reliable and engaging content to us over time.Going ahead While earlystage startups form the core of Peppers present clientele it wants to take its services to a large number of SMEs in the next one or two years.
The 11member startup also wants to engage students and create studentdriven communities in different spheres of the content industry.
Anirudh says Our target is to reach 100 companies by the end of this year.
We are also getting into creating short 60second videos for products and websites.
But first we want to monopolise textbased content.
Pepper will shortly be incubated at BITS Pilanis newly launched Technology Business Incubator TBI.
The startup is presently being mentored by former Tech Mahindra CEO Kiran Deshpande who now serves as the President of Mojo Networks.
Hes also a charter member of TiE Pune and his guidance in making us a onestop content destination is critical Anirudh says.

For other uses see Peppercorn disambiguation.Black pepperPepper plant with immature peppercornsScientific classification KingdomPlantaeCladeAngiospermsCladeMagnoliidsOrderPiperalesFamilyPiperaceaeGenusPiperSpeciesP.nigrumBinomial namePiper nigrumL.1Black pepper Piper nigrum is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae cultivated for its fruit which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning known as a peppercorn.
When fresh and fully mature it is about 5mm 0.20in in diameter and dark red and contains a single seed like all drupes.
Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper or more precisely as black pepper cooked and dried unripe fruit green pepper dried unripe fruit and white pepper ripe fruit seeds.Black pepper is native to Kerala in Southwestern India23 and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions.
Vietnam is the worlds largest producer and exporter of pepper producing 34 of the worlds P. nigrum crop as of 2013.Dried ground pepper has been used since antiquity both for its flavour and as a traditional medicine.
Black pepper is the worlds most traded spice and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world.
Its spiciness is due to the chemical piperine not to be confused with the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers.
It is ubiquitous in the modern world as a seasoning and is often paired with salt.Contents1 Etymology2 Varieties2.1 Black pepper2.2 White pepper2.3 Green pepper2.4 Wild pepper2.5 Orange pepper and red pepper2.6 Pink pepper and other plants used as pepper3 Plants4 Production and trade5 History5.1 Ancient times5.2 Postclassical Europe5.3 China6 Phytochemicals folk medicine and research6.1 Nutrition7 Flavor8 See also9 References10 Bibliography11 External linksEtymologyeditThe word pepper has roots in the Sanskrit word pippali for long pepper.456 Ancient Greek and Latin turned pippali into the Greek  peperi and then into the Latin piper which the Romans used for both black pepper and long pepper erroneously believing that both came from the same plant.From its Sanskrit roots todays pepper is derived from the Old English pipor7 and from Latin which is the source of Romanian piper Italian pepe Dutch peper German Pfeffer French poivre and other similar forms.7In the 16th century people began using pepper to also mean the unrelated New World chili pepper.
People have also used pepper in a figurative sense to mean spirit or energy at least as far back as the 1840s.
In the early 20th century this shortened to pep.7Varietiesedit Black and white peppercornsBlack peppereditBlack pepper is produced from the stillgreen unripe drupes of the pepper plant.
The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water both to clean them and to prepare them for drying.
The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying.
The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days during which the pepper skin around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin wrinkled black layer.
Once dry the spice is called black peppercorn.
On some estates the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sundried without the boiling process.Once the peppercorns are dried pepper spirit and oil can be extracted from the berries by crushing them.
Pepper spirit is used in many medicinal and beauty products.
Pepper oil is also used as an ayurvedic massage oil and in certain beauty and herbal treatments.Black pepper P. nigrum essential oil in a clear glass vialGround black pepper and a plastic pepper shakerRoughly cracked black peppercorns also known as mignonette or poivre mignonette Six variants of peppercorns two types of white and two types of black based on regionWhite peppereditWhite pepper redirects here.
For the Ween album see White Pepper.
White pepper grainsWhite pepper consists solely of the seed of the pepper plant with the darkercoloured skin of the pepper fruit removed.
This is usually accomplished by a process known as retting where fully ripe red pepper berries are soaked in water for about a week during which the flesh of the pepper softens and decomposes.
Rubbing then removes what remains of the fruit and the naked seed is dried.
Sometimes alternative processes are used for removing the outer pepper from the seed including removing the outer layer through mechanical chemical or biological methods.8Ground white pepper is used in Chinese and Thai cuisine but also in salads cream sauces lightcoloured sauces and mashed potatoes where black pepper would visibly stand out.
White pepper has a different flavour from black pepper it lacks certain compounds present in the outer layer of the drupe.
Black green pink Schinus terebinthifolius and white peppercornsGreen peppereditGreen pepper like black is made from the unripe drupes.
Dried green peppercorns are treated in a way that retains the green colour such as treatment with sulphur dioxide canning or freezedrying.
Pickled peppercorns also green are unripe drupes preserved in brine or vinegar.
Fresh unpreserved green pepper drupes largely unknown in the West are used in some Asian cuisines particularly Thai cuisine.
Their flavour has been described as spicy and fresh with a bright aroma.9 They decay quickly if not dried or preserved.Wild peppereditWild pepper grows in the Western Ghats region of India.
Into the 19th century the forests contained expansive wild pepper vines as recorded by the Scottish physician Francis Buchanan also a botanist and geographer in his book A journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore Canara and Malabar Volume III.10 However deforestation resulted in wild pepper growing in more limited forest patches from Goa to Kerala with the wild source gradually decreasing as the quality and yield of the cultivated variety improved.
No successful grafting of commercial pepper on wild pepper has been achieved to date.10Orange pepper and red peppereditOrange pepper or red pepper usually consists of ripe red pepper drupes preserved in brine and vinegar.
Ripe red peppercorns can also be dried using the same colourpreserving techniques used to produce green pepper.11Pink pepper and other plants used as peppereditPink peppercorns are the fruits of a plant from a different family the Peruvian pepper tree Schinus molle or its relative the Brazilian pepper tree Schinus terebinthifolius.
As they are members of the cashew family they may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis for persons with a tree nut allergy.The bark of Drimys winteri canelo or winters bark is used as a substitute for pepper in cold and temperate regions of Chile and Argentina where it is easily available.In New Zealand the seeds of kawakawa Macropiper excelsum a relative of black pepper are sometimes used as pepper and the leaves of Pseudowintera colorata mountain horopito are another replacement for pepper.Several plants in the United States are used also as pepper substitutes such as Lepidium campestre Lepidium virginicum shepherds purse horseradish and field pennycress.Plantsedit Piper nigrum from an 1832 print Unripe drupes of P. nigrum at Trivandrum Kerala IndiaThe pepper plant is a perennial woody vine growing up to 4m 13ft in height on supporting trees poles or trellises.
It is a spreading vine rooting readily where trailing stems touch the ground.
The leaves are alternate entire 5 to 10cm 2.0 to 3.9in long and 3 to 6cm 1.2 to 2.4in across.
The flowers are small produced on pendulous spikes 4 to 8cm 1.6 to 3.1in long at the leaf nodes the spikes lengthening up to 7 to 15cm 2.8 to 5.9in as the fruit matures.12 Pepper can be grown in soil that is neither too dry nor susceptible to flooding moist welldrained and rich in organic matter the vines do not do too well over an altitude of 900m 3000ft above sea level.
The plants are propagated by cuttings about 40 to 50cm 16 to 20in long tied up to neighbouring trees or climbing frames at distances of about 2m 6ft 7in apart trees with rough bark are favoured over those with smooth bark as the pepper plants climb rough bark more readily.
Competing plants are cleared away leaving only sufficient trees to provide shade and permit free ventilation.
The roots are covered in leaf mulch and manure and the shoots are trimmed twice a year.
On dry soils the young plants require watering every other day during the dry season for the first three years.
The plants bear fruit from the fourth or fifth year and then typically for seven years.
The cuttings are usually cultivars selected both for yield and quality of fruit.A single stem bears 20 to 30 fruiting spikes.
The harvest begins as soon as one or two fruits at the base of the spikes begin to turn red and before the fruit is fully mature and still hard if allowed to ripen completely the fruit lose pungency and ultimately fall off and are lost.
The spikes are collected and spread out to dry in the sun then the peppercorns are stripped off the spikes.12Black pepper is native either to Southeast Asia13 or South Asia.14 Within the genus Piper it is most closely related to other Asian species such as P. caninum.14P.

Innes Miller notes that while pepper was grown in southern Thailand and in Malaysia its most important source was India particularly the Malabar Coast in what is now the state of Kerala.19 The lost ancient port city of Muziris in Kerala famous for exporting black pepper and various other spices gets mentioned in a number of classical historical sources.20212223 Peppercorns were a muchprized trade good often referred to as black gold and used as a form of commodity money.
The legacy of this trade remains in some Western legal systems that recognize the term peppercorn rent as a token payment for something that is essentially being given.The ancient history of black pepper is often interlinked with and confused with that of long pepper the dried fruit of closely related Piper longum.
The Romans knew of both and often referred to either as just piper.
In fact the popularity of long pepper did not entirely decline until the discovery of the New World and of chili peppers.
Chili pepperssome of which when dried are similar in shape and taste to long pepperwere easier to grow in a variety of locations more convenient to Europe.Before the 16th century pepper was being grown in Java Sunda Sumatra Madagascar Malaysia and everywhere in Southeast Asia.
These areas traded mainly with China or used the pepper locally.24 Ports in the Malabar area also served as a stopoff point for much of the trade in other spices from farther east in the Indian Ocean.
Following the British hegemony in India virtually all of the black pepper found in Europe the Middle East and North Africa was traded from Malabar region.Ancient timeseditBlack peppercorns were found stuffed in the nostrils of Ramesses II placed there as part of the mummification rituals shortly after his death in 1213 BCE.25 Little else is known about the use of pepper in ancient Egypt and how it reached the Nile from South Asia.Pepper both long and black was known in Greece at least as early as the fourth century BCE though it was probably an uncommon and expensive item that only the very rich could afford.
A Romanera trade route from India to ItalyBy the time of the early Roman Empire especially after Romes conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE openocean crossing of the Arabian Sea direct to southern Indias Malabar Coast was near routine.
Details of this trading across the Indian Ocean have been passed down in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.
According to the Roman geographer Strabo the early empire sent a fleet of around 120 ships on an annual oneyear trip to China Southeast Asia India and back.
The fleet timed its travel across the Arabian Sea to take advantage of the predictable monsoon winds.
Returning from India the ships travelled up the Red Sea from where the cargo was carried overland or via the NileRed Sea canal to the Nile River barged to Alexandria and shipped from there to Italy and Rome.
The rough geographical outlines of this same trade route would dominate the pepper trade into Europe for a millennium and a half to come.With ships sailing directly to the Malabar coast black pepper was now travelling a shorter trade route than long pepper and the prices reflected it.
Pliny the Elders Natural History tells us the prices in Rome around 77 CE Long pepper ... is 15 denarii per pound while that of white pepper is seven and of black four.
Pliny also complains There is no year in which India does not drain the Roman Empire of 50 million sesterces and further moralizes on pepperIt is quite surprising that the use of pepper has come so much into fashion seeing that in other substances which we use it is sometimes their sweetness and sometimes their appearance that has attracted our notice whereas pepper has nothing in it that can plead as a recommendation to either fruit or berry its only desirable quality being a certain pungency and yet it is for this that we import it all the way from India Who was the first to make trial of it as an article of food and who I wonder was the man that was not content to prepare himself by hunger only for the satisfying of a greedy appetite N.H. 12.1426Black pepper was a wellknown and widespread if expensive seasoning in the Roman Empire.
Apicius De re coquinaria a thirdcentury cookbook probably based at least partly on one from the first century CE includes pepper in a majority of its recipes.
Edward Gibbon wrote in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire that pepper was a favorite ingredient of the most expensive Roman cookery.Postclassical EuropeeditPepper was so valuable that it was often used as collateral or even currency.
In the Dutch language pepper expensive peperduur is an expression for something very expensive.
The taste for pepper or the appreciation of its monetary value was passed on to those who would see Rome fall.
Alaric the Visigoth included 3000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he besieged the city in fifth century.27 After the fall of Rome others took over the middle legs of the spice trade first the Persians and then the Arabs Innes Miller cites the account of Cosmas Indicopleustes who travelled east to India as proof that pepper was still being exported from India in the sixth century.28 By the end of the Early Middle Ages the central portions of the spice trade were firmly under Islamic control.
Once into the Mediterranean the trade was largely monopolized by Italian powers especially Venice and Genoa.
The rise of these citystates was funded in large part by the spice trade.A riddle authored by Saint Aldhelm a seventhcentury Bishop of Sherborne sheds some light on black peppers role in England at that timeI am black on the outside clad in a wrinkled coverYet within I bear a burning marrow.I season delicacies the banquets of kings and the luxuries of the tableBoth the sauces and the tenderized meats of the kitchen.But you will find in me no quality of any worthUnless your bowels have been rattled by my gleaming marrow.29During the Middle Ages pepper was commonly believed to be used to conceal the taste of partially rotten meat.
No evidence supports this claim and historians view it as highly unlikely in the Middle Ages pepper was a luxury item affordable only to the wealthy who certainly had unspoiled meat available as well.30 In addition people of the time certainly knew that eating spoiled food would make them sick.
Similarly the belief that pepper was widely used as a preservative is questionable it is true that piperine the compound that gives pepper its spiciness has some antimicrobial properties but at the concentrations present when pepper is used as a spice the effect is small.31 Salt is a much more effective preservative and saltcured meats were common fare especially in winter.
However pepper and other spices certainly played a role in improving the taste of longpreserved meats.
A depiction of Calicut India published in 1572 during Portugals control of the pepper tradeIts exorbitant price during the Middle Agesand the monopoly on the trade held by Italywas one of the inducements that led the Portuguese to seek a sea route to India.
In 1498 Vasco da Gama became the first person to reach India by sailing around Africa see Age of Discovery asked by Arabs in Calicut who spoke Spanish and Italian why they had come his representative replied we seek Christians and spices.
Though this first trip to India by way of the southern tip of Africa was only a modest success the Portuguese quickly returned in greater numbers and eventually gained much greater control of trade on the Arabian Sea.
The 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas with the Spanish granted Portugal exclusive rights to the half of the world where black pepper originated.Unsurprisingly the Portuguese proved unable to monopolize the spice trade.
Older Arab and Venetian trade networks successfully imported enormous quantities of spices and pepper once again flowed through Alexandria and Italy as well as around Africa.
In the 17th century the Portuguese lost almost all of their valuable Indian Ocean trade to the Dutch and the English who taking advantage from the Spanish ruling over Portugal during Iberian Union 15801640 occupied by force almost all Portuguese dominations in the area.
The pepper ports of Malabar began to trade increasingly with the Dutch in the period 16611663. Pepper harvested for the European trader from a manuscript Livre des merveilles de Marco Polo The book of the marvels of Marco Polo Pepper millAs pepper supplies into Europe increased the price of pepper declined though the total value of the import trade generally did not.
Pepper which in the early Middle Ages had been an item exclusively for the rich started to become more of an everyday seasoning among those of more average means.
Today pepper accounts for onefifth of the worlds spice trade.32ChinaeditIt is possible that black pepper was known in China in the second century BCE if poetic reports regarding an explorer named Tang Meng  are correct.
Sent by Emperor Wu to what is now southwest China Tang Meng is said to have come across something called jujiang or saucebetel.
He was told it came from the markets of Shu an area in what is now the Sichuan province.
The traditional view among historians is that saucebetel is a sauce made from betel leaves but arguments have been made that it actually refers to pepper either long or black.33In the third century CE black pepper made its first definite appearance in Chinese texts as hujiao or foreign pepper.
It does not appear to have been widely known at the time failing to appear in a fourthcentury work describing a wide variety of spices from beyond Chinas southern border including long pepper.34 By the 12th century however black pepper had become a popular ingredient in the cuisine of the wealthy and powerful sometimes taking the place of Chinas native Sichuan pepper the tonguenumbing dried fruit of an unrelated plant.Marco Polo testifies to peppers popularity in 13thcentury China when he relates what he is told of its consumption in the city of Kinsay Hangzhou ...Messer Marco heard it stated by one of the Great Kaans officers of customs that the quantity of pepper introduced daily for consumption into the city of Kinsay amounted to 43loads each load being equal to 223lbs.35 Marco Polo is not considered a very reliable source regarding China and these secondhand data may be even more suspect but if this estimated 10000 pounds 4500kg a day for one city is anywhere near the truth Chinas pepper imports may have dwarfed Europes.During the course of the treasure voyages in the early 15th century Admiral Zheng He and his expeditionary fleets returned with such a large amount of black pepper that the oncecostly luxury became a common commodity.36Phytochemicals folk medicine and researchedit Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing.
Alice in Wonderland 1865.
Chapter VI Pig and Pepper.
Note the cooks pepper mill.Like many eastern spices pepper was historically both a seasoning and a folk medicine.
Long pepper being stronger was often the preferred medication but both were used.
Black pepper or perhaps long pepper was believed to cure several illnesses such as constipation insomnia oral abscesses sunburn and toothaches among others.37 Various sources from the fifth century onward recommended pepper to treat eye problems often by applying salves or poultices made with pepper directly to the eye.
No current medical evidence indicates any of these treatments has any benefit.38Pepper is known to cause sneezing.
Some sources say that piperine a substance present in black pepper irritates the nostrils causing the sneezing.39 Few if any controlled studies have been carried out to answer the question.Piperine is under study for its potential to increase absorption of selenium vitamin B12 betacarotene and curcumin as well as other compounds.40 As a folk medicine pepper appears in the Buddhist Samaaphala Sutta chapter five as one of the few medicines a monk is allowed to carry.41Pepper contains phytochemicals42 including amides piperidines pyrrolidines and trace amounts of safrole which may be carcinogenic in laboratory rodents.43Piperine is also under study for a variety of possible physiological effects44 although this work is preliminary and mechanisms of activity for piperine in the human body remain unknown.NutritioneditOne tablespoon 6 grams of ground black pepper contains moderate amounts of vitamin K 13 of the daily value or DV iron 10 DV and manganese 18 DV with trace amounts of other essential nutrients protein and dietary fibre.45Flavoredit Handheld pepper mills Black pepper grainsPepper gets its spicy heat mostly from piperine derived both from the outer fruit and the seed.
Black pepper contains between 4.6 and 9.7 piperine by mass and white pepper slightly more than that.46 Refined piperine by weight is about one percent as hot as the capsaicin found in chili peppers.47 The outer fruit layer left on black pepper also contains aromacontributing terpenes including germacrene 11 limonene 10 pinene 10 alphaphellandrene 9 and betacaryophyllene 748 which give citrusy woody and floral notes.
These scents are mostly missing in white pepper which is stripped of the fruit layer.
White pepper can gain different odours including musty notes from its longer fermentation stage.49 The aroma of pepper is attributed to rotundone 345678Hexahydro38dimethyl51methylethenylazulene12Hone a sesquiterpene originally discovered in the tubers of Cyperus rotundus which can be detected in concentrations of 0.4 nanogramsl in water and in wine rotundone is also present in marjoram oregano rosemary basil thyme and geranium as well as in some Shiraz wines.50Pepper loses flavor and aroma through evaporation so airtight storage helps preserve its spiciness longer.
Pepper can also lose flavor when exposed to light which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine.49 Once ground peppers aromatics can evaporate quickly most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason.
Handheld pepper mills or grinders which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns are used for this as an alternative to pepper shakers that dispense ground pepper.
Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens as early as the 14th century but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries as well.51See alsoeditFalse black pepperMalabar pepperPeppercorn sauceSaltReferencesedit Piper nigrum.
