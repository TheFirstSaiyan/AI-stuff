The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative the Chinaberry Melia azedarach.The opposite pinnate leaves are 2040 centimetres 7.915.7in long with 20 to 31 medium to dark green leaflets about 38 centimetres 1.23.1in long.
The terminal leaflet often is missing.
The petioles are short.The white and fragrant flowers are arranged in moreorless drooping axillary panicles which are up to 25 centimetres 9.8in long.
The inflorescences which branch up to the third degree bear from 150 to 250 flowers.
An individual flower is 56 millimetres 0.200.24in long and 811 millimetres 0.310.43in wide.
Protandrous bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.The fruit is a smooth glabrous olivelike drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish and when ripe is 1.42.8 centimetres 0.551.10in by 1.01.5 centimetres 0.390.59in.
The fruit skin exocarp is thin and the bittersweet pulp mesocarp is yellowishwhite and very fibrous.
The mesocarp is 0.30.5 centimetres 0.120.20in thick.
The white hard inner shell endocarp of the fruit encloses one rarely two or three elongated seeds kernels having a brown seed coat.
The neem tree is often confused with a similar looking tree called bakain.
Bakain also has toothed leaflets and similar looking fruit.
One difference is that neem leaves are pinnate but bakain leaves are twice and thricepinnate.
Itsclarification needed fruit are shaped like miniature apples.citation neededEtymologyeditNeem  is a Hindi noun derived from Sanskrit Nimba .345EcologyeditThe neem tree is noted for its drought resistance.
Normally it thrives in areas with subarid to subhumid conditions with an annual rainfall of 4001200 millimetres 1647in.
It can grow in regions with an annual rainfall below 400mm but in such cases it depends largely on ground water levels.
Neem can grow in many different types of soil but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils.
It is a typical tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures of 2132C 7090F.
It can tolerate high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below 4C 39F.
Neem is one of a very few shadegiving trees that thrive in droughtprone areas e.g.
the dry coastal southern districts of India and Pakistan.
The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle of water whatever the quality.
In India and tropical countries where the Indian diaspora has reached it is very common to see neem trees used for shade lining streets around temples schools and other such public buildings or in most peoples back yards.
In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of land.Weed statuseditNeem is considered a weed in many areas including some parts of the Middle East most of SubSaharan Africa including West Africa and Indian Ocean states and some parts of Australia.
Ecologically it survives well in similar environments to its own but its weed potential has not been fully assessed.6In April 2015 A. indica was declared a class B and C weed in the Northern Territory Australia meaning its growth and spread must be controlled and plants or propagules are not allowed to be brought into the NT.
It is illegal to buy sell or transport the plants or seeds.
Its declaration as a weed came in response to its invasion of waterways in the Top End of the territory.7After being introduced into Australia possibly in the 1940s A. indica was originally planted in the Northern Territory to provide shade for cattle.
Trial plantations were established between the 1960s and 1980s in Darwin Queensland and Western Australia but the Australian neem industry did not prove viable.
The tree has now spread into the savanna particularly around waterways and naturalised populations exist in several areas.8Usesedit Neem Tree farm from south india A large tree Leaves Bark ineem Seeds Twigs for sale Fruit drying for oil extractionNeem leaves are dried in India and placed in cupboards to prevent insects eating the clothes and also in tins where rice is stored.9 Neem leaves are dried and burnt in the tropical regions to keep away mosquitoes.citation needed These flowers are also used in many Indian festivals like Ugadi.
See below Association with Hindu festivals in India.
As an ayurvedic herb neem is also used in baths.As a vegetableeditThe tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India.
A souplike dish called Veppampoo charu Tamil translated as neem flower rasam made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu.
In Bengal young neem leaves are fried in oil with tiny pieces of eggplant brinjal.
The dish is called nim begun and is the first item during a Bengali meal that acts as an appetizer.
It is eaten with rice.10Neem is used in parts of mainland Southeast Asia particularly in Cambodia aka sdov11 Laos where it is called kadao Thailand where it is known as sadao or sdao Myanmar where it is known as tamar and Vietnam where it is known as su u and is used to cook the salad gi su u.
Even lightly cooked the flavour is quite bitter and the food is not enjoyed by all inhabitants of these nations though it is believed to be good for ones health.
Neem gum is a rich source of protein.
In Myanmar young neem leaves and flower buds are boiled with tamarind fruit to soften its bitterness and eaten as a vegetable.
Pickled neem leaves are also eaten with tomato and fish paste sauce in Myanmar.Traditional medicinal useeditProducts made from neem trees have been used in India for over two millennia for their medicinal properties.9 Neem products are believed by Siddha and Ayurvedic practitioners to be anthelmintic antifungal antidiabetic antibacterial antiviral contraceptive and sedative.12 It is considered a major component in siddha medicine and Ayurvedic and Unani medicine and is particularly prescribed for skin diseases.13 Neem oil is also used for healthy hair to improve liver function detoxify the blood and balance blood sugar levels.14 Neem leaves have also been used to treat skin diseases like eczema psoriasis etc.9Insufficient research has been done to assess the purported benefits of neem however.15 In adults shortterm use of neem is safe while longterm use may harm the kidneys or liver in small children neem oil is toxic and can lead to death.15 Neem may also cause miscarriages infertility and low blood sugar.15Safety issueseditNeem oil can cause some forms of toxic encephalopathy and ophthalmopathy if consumed in large quantities.16Pest and disease controleditNeem Ineem is a key ingredient in nonpesticidal management NPM providing a natural alternative to synthetic pesticides.
Neem seeds are ground into a powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop.
To be effective it must be applied repeatedly at least every ten days.
Neem does not directly kill insects on the crop.
It acts as an antifeedant repellent and egglaying deterrent protecting the crop from damage.
The insects starve and die within a few days.
Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs.
Neembased fertilizeres have been effective against the pest southern armyworm.
Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer.17Neem oil has been shown to avert termite attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent.18Neem oil for polymeric resinseditApplications of neem oil in the preparation of polymeric resins have been documented in the recent reports.
The synthesis of various alkyd resins from neem oil is reported using a monoglyceride MG route and their utilization for the preparation of PU coatings.19 The alkyds are prepared from reaction of conventional divalent acid materials like phthalic and maleic anhydrides with MG of neem oil.ConstructioneditThe juice of this plant is a potent ingredient for a mixture of wall plaster according to the Samargaa Stradhra which is a Sanskrit treatise dealing with ilpastra Hindu science of art and construction.20Other usesedit cleaning teeth by chewing stickHair Comb Wood of neem tree is used to handcraft hair combs and it is believed that regular use can control hair loss dandruff and other scalp problems.Toiletries Neem oil is used for preparing cosmetics such as soap shampoo balms and creams as well as toothpasteAnimal Treatment Used to treat sweet itch and mud fever in horsesToothbrush Traditionally slender neem twigs called datun are first chewed as a toothbrush and then split as a tongue cleaner.21 This practice has been in use in India Africa and the Middle East for centuries.
It is still used in Indias rural areas.
Neem twigs are still collected and sold in rural markets for this use.
It has been found to be as effective as a toothbrush in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation.2223Tree Besides its use in traditional Indian medicine the neem tree is of great importance for its antidesertification properties and possibly as a good carbon dioxide sink.242526Neem gum is used as a bulking agent and for the preparation of special purpose foods.Neem blossoms are used in Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to prepare Ugadi pachhadi.
A mixture of neem flowers and jaggery or unrefined brown sugar is prepared and offered to friends and relatives symbolic of sweet and bitter events in the upcoming new year Ugadi.
Bevina hoovina gojju a type of curry prepared with neem blossoms is common in Karnataka throughout the year.
Dried blossoms are used when fresh blossoms are not available.
In Tamil Nadu a rasam veppam poo rasam made with neem blossoms is a culinary specialty.Cosmetics Neem is perceived in India as a beauty aid.
Powdered leaves are a major component of at least one widely used facial cream.
Purified neem oil is also used in nail polish and other cosmetics.Bird repellent Neem leaf boiled in water can be used as a very costeffective bird repellent especially for sparrows.Lubricant Neem oil is nondrying and it resists degradation better than most vegetable oils.
In rural India it is commonly used to grease cart wheels.Fertilizer Neem extract is added to fertilizers urea as a nitrification inhibitor.27Plant protectant Ploughed into the soil it protects plant roots from nematodes and white ants probably as it contains the residual limonoids.citation needed In Karnataka people grow the tree mainly for its green leaves and twigs which they puddle into flooded rice fields before the rice seedlings are transplanted.Resin An exudate can be tapped from the trunk by wounding the bark.
This high protein material is not a substitute for polysaccharide gum such as gum arabic.
It may however have a potential as a food additive and it is widely used in South Asia as Neem glue.Bark Neem bark contains 14 tannin an amount similar to that in conventional tanninyielding trees such as Acacia decurrens.
Moreover it yields a strong coarse fibre commonly woven into ropes in the villages of India.Honey In parts of Asia neem honey commands premium prices and people promote apiculture by planting neem trees.Soap 80 of Indias supply of neem oil now is used by neem oil soap manufacturers.28 Although much of it goes to smallscale speciality soaps often using coldpressed oil largescale producers also use it mainly because it is cheap.
Additionally it is antibacterial and antifungal soothing and moisturising.
It can be made with up to 40 neem oil.28 Generally the crude oil is used to produce coarse laundry soaps.Against pox viruses In India people who are affected with pox viruses are generally made to lie in a bed made of neem leaves and branches.citation needed The belief is that it prevents the spreading of pox virus to otherscitation needed and has been in practice since early centuries.citation neededAnimal feed Neem leaves can be occasionally used as forage for ruminants and rabbits.29Association with Hindu festivals in IndiaeditNeem leaf or bark is considered an effective pitta pacifier because of its bitter taste.
Hence it is traditionally recommended during early summer in Ayurveda that is the month of Chaitra as per the Hindu Calendar which usually falls in the month of March  April.In the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Telangana Neem flowers are very popular for their use in Ugadi Pachhadi souplike pickle which is made on Ugadi day.In Andhra Pradesh Karnataka and Telangana a small amount of Neem and Jaggery BevuBella is consumed on Ugadi day the Telugu and Kannada new year indicating that one should take both bitter and sweet things in life joy and sorrow.During Gudi Padva which is the New Year in the state of Maharashtra the ancient practice of drinking a small quantity of neem juice or paste on that day before starting festivities is found.
As in many Hindu festivals and their association with some food to avoid negative sideeffects of the season or change of seasons neem juice is associated with Gudi Padva to remind people to use it during that particular month or season to pacify summer pitta.In Tamil Nadu during the summer months of April to June the Mariamman temple festival is a thousandyearold tradition.
The Neem leaves and flowers are the most important part of the Mariamman festival.
The statue of the goddess Mariamman will be garlanded with Neem leaves and flowers.
During most occasions of celebrations and weddings the people of Tamil Nadu adorn their surroundings with the Neem leaves and flowers as a form of decoration and also to ward off evil spirits and infections.In the eastern coastal state of Odisha the famous Jagannath temple deities are made up of Neem heart wood along with some other essential oils and powders.
Native of Chhattisgarh with Neem branches and leaves for Hareli FestivalChemical compoundseditAyurveda was the first to bring the anthelmintic antifungal antibacterial and antiviral constituents of the neem tree to the attention of natural products chemists.
The process of extracting neem oil involves extracting the waterinsoluble components with ether petrol ether ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol.
The provisional naming was nimbin sulphurfree crystalline product with melting point at 205C empirical composition C7H10O2 nimbinin with similar principle melting at 192C and nimbidin creamcoloured containing amorphous sulphur melting at 90100C.
Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil.30full citation needed These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem.
They also serve as natural insecticides.31full citation neededNeemcoated urea is being used an alternate to plain urea fertilizer in India.
It reduces pollution improves fertilizers efficacy and soil health.3233Genome and transcriptomeseditNeem genome and transcriptomes from various organs have been sequenced analyzed and published by Ganit Labs in Bangalore India.343536ESTs were identify by generation of subtractive hybridization libraries of neem fruit leaf fruit mesocarp and fruit endocarp by CSIRCIMAP Lucknow.3738Cultural and social impacteditIn Theravada Buddhism the neem tree is said to have been used to achieve enlightenment bodhi by Tissa the twentieth Lord Buddha.citation needed Some sources claim however that Terminalia tomentosa was the Bodhi tree used.citation neededThe name Nimai a reference to this legend means of the neem tree and trends at 510 babies per million.39In 1995 the European Patent Office EPO granted a patent on an antifungal product derived from neem to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace and Company.40 The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2000 years.
In 2000 the EPO ruled in Indias favour but W. R. Grace appealed claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal.
On 8March 2005 that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent.40SymbolismeditPreviously neem had been declared as the national tree of the former Hyderabad State.citation needed It is the state plant of Arunachal Pradesh.citation neededBiotechnologyeditThe biopesticide produced by extraction from the tree seeds contains limonoids.
Currently the extraction process has disadvantages such as contamination with fungi and heterogeneity in the content of limonoids due to genetic climatic and geographical variations.4142 To overcome these problems production of limonoids from plant cell suspension and hairy root cultures in bioreactors has been studied4344 including the development of a twostage bioreactor process that enhances growth and production of limonoids with cell suspension cultures of A. indica.45GalleryeditFlowersUnripe fruitNeem tree in a banana farm in IndiaNeem tree farmSee alsoeditAzadirachtinArid Forest Research Institute AFRINeem cakeNeem oilBabool brand of toothpasteTeeth cleaning twig datunReferencesedit a b Azadirachta indica.

All parts of neem are used for preparing many different medicines especially for skin disease.4A compound from the Neem tree can be used as a spermicide .Neem oil is used for preparing cosmetics soap and shampoo ozone as well as lotions and others and is useful for skin care such as acne treatment.
Neem oil has been used effectively as a mosquito repellent.Neem is useful for damaging over 500 types of insects mites ticks and nematodes by changing the way they grow and act.
Neem does not normally kill pests right away rather it slows their growth and drives them away.
As neem products are cheap and not poisonous to animals and friendly insects they are good for pest controlIn the UK plant protection products that contain azadirachtin the active ingredient of neem oil are illegal.5Referenceschange  change source D.P.

SaveCancel7MedicinalsSince antiquity neem has been renowned for healing.
The earliest Sanskrit medical writings refer to the benefits of its fruits seeds oil leaves roots and bark.1 Each of these has long been used in the Indian Ayurveda and Unani systems of medicine.
Thus over thousands of years millions of Asians have used neem medicinally.
In addition in places where the tree has been introduced in recent times such as tropical America and Africa it has also established a reputation as a useful cure for various ailments.Today the bestestablished and most widely recognized uses are based on its merits as a general antiseptic.
Neem preparations are reportedly efficacious against a variety of skin diseases septic sores and infected burns.
The leaves applied in the form of poultices or decoctions are also recommended for boils ulcers and eczema.
The oil is used for skin diseases such as scrofula indolent ulcers and ringworm.Cures for many more ailments have been claimed but have not been independently confirmed by trials under controlled conditions.
Nonetheless there are intriguing indications that neem might in future be used much more widely.
These promising but unproved applications include antiinflammatory hypotensive and antiulcer treatments.A summary of some recent results in medical and veterinary studies follows.FUNGICIDESNeem has proved effective against certain fungi that infect the human body.
Such fungi are an increasing problem and have been difficult to control by synthetic fungicides.
For example in one laboratory study21The trees Sanskrit name was arishtha meaning reliever of sickness.2Khan and Wassilew.

Many strains are now resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics one reason for the widespread occurrence of staphylococcal infections in hospitals.Salmonella typhosa.4 This muchfeared bacterium which lives in food and water causes typhoid food poisoning and a variety of infections that include blood poisoning and intestinal inflammation.
Current antibiotics are of only uncertain help in treating it.However neem has many limitations as an antibiotic.
In the latter test neem showed no antibacterial activity against certain strains of the above bacteria and none against Citrobacter Escherichia coli Enterobacter Klebsiella pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Proteus morgasi Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas EO1 and Streptococcus faecalis.ANTIVIRAL AGENTSIn India there is much interesting but anecdotal information attributing antiviral activity to neem.

SaveCancelpox virusesis strongly believed even among those of advanced medical training.
Smallpox chicken pox and warts have traditionally been treated with a paste of neem leavesusually rubbed directly onto the infected skin.
Experiments with smallpox chicken pox and fowl pox suggest that there may be a true biological basis for this practice.
Crude neem extracts absorbed the viruses effectively preventing them from entering uninfected cells.5 Unfortunately no antiviral effects were seen once the infection was established within the cell.
Thus neem was effective prevention but not cure.Recent pharmacological studies have supported the belief that neem leaves possess some antiviral activity.
So far these are only preliminary and unconfirmed results but they are intriguing nonetheless.
In the United States aqueous neemleaf extracts have shown low to moderate inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase of hepatitis B virus.6 In Germany an ethanolic neemkernel extract has proved effective against herpes virus.7 And in horticultural studies crude extracts also seemed to effectively bind certain plant viruses and so limit infection see Chapter 6.Should these early results prove to be soundly based an array of extremely virulent and difficult diseases of peoplenot to mention of wildlife and livestockmight be treated.DERMATOLOGICAL INSECTSGiven all of neems insecticidal properties it is perhaps not unexpected that it is a common folk remedy against maggots and head lice.
In Haiti for instance crushed leaves are rubbed into open wounds that have become maggot infested.
And in India and Bangladesh villagers apply neem oil to the hair to kill head lice reportedly with great success.DENTAL TREATMENTSAs noted earlier both in India and Africa millions of people use twigs as toothbrushes every day.
For many the twig is neem.
Dentists have endorsed this ancient practice finding it effective in preventing periodontal disease.8 It is unclear whether the benefit is due to regular gum massage to preventing plaque buildup to neems inherent antiseptic action or to all three.5Rao et al.

SaveCancelPeople using neem sticks as disposable toothbrushes are commonly seen in rural regions of South Asia and Africa.
Research has found that neem twigs contain antiseptic ingredients and they are able to maintain healthy teeth and gums.
M. ElvinLewisAs also noted earlier a German company uses neem actually extracts of bark as the active ingredient in toothpastes and other oral hygiene preparations.
It claims that its tests prove neem bark to be highly effective at both preventing and healing gum inflammations and periodontal disease.CHAGAS DISEASEExtracts of neem reportedly affect the kissing bugs that transmit the muchfeared Chagas disease see sidebar page 64.
They do not kill the insect instead they immunize it against parasites that live inside it for part of their life cycle.9 The discovery may point the way to9Information from H. Rembold and E.S.

SaveCancelChagas DiseaseAbout 20 million Latin Americans are infected with Chagas disease many live as helpless cripples unable to work or enjoy life.
A parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes this major health problem.
It lives and reproduces inside nerve and muscle cells particularly those of the heart and drains its victims of all their energy.The parasitea trypanosome related to the wellknown one that causes the dreaded sleeping sickness in Africais spread by the socalled kissing bugs.
Similar to large bedbugs these insects inhabit cracks and crevices in the walls and roofs of huts and houses in rural areas.
Emerging at night they bite and suck the blood of any sleeping people pets or livestock they encounter.In this way kissing bugs pick up the parasite but they pass it on not through their bite but through their droppings.
The parasite develops and multiplies within the bugs hindgut and in its infective stage passes out with the excrement.
Kissing bugs often defecate while they are feeding and when the victim wakes up and scratches the itchy bump the excrement together with the parasites infective stage is rubbed into the wound and enters the bloodstream.So far there is no truly satisfactory control for this dread disease but laboratories in Germany and Brazil have recently produced the makings of a possible breakthrough involving neem.At the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Martinsried Germany Heinz Rembold has been raising one species of kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus to study the effects of azadirachtin on its hormone system.
He found that azadirachtin prevents young kissing bugs from molting and therefore from ever maturing and it interferes with the adults ability to reproduce.The other prong of this research is being done at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro Brazil.
There Eloi Garcia and his research team keep both parasitefree and parasiteinfected kissing bugs.
Recently when they fed blood laced with azadirachtin to a group of infected bugs they made a surprising discovery 20 days later the bugs were parasite free.Rembold and Garcia believe that azadirachtin somehow disrupts the carefully synchronized arrangement that allowsPage 65 ShareCiteSuggested Citation7   Medicinals.

They found that even a few micrograms of azadirachtin taken up with a blood meal proved effective and that the bugs remained free of infection even 20 days after they had eaten blood laden with parasites.Garcia et al.
1984.controlling this major health problem in Latin America although delivering neem materials to these tiny bloodsuckers in rural hovels is perhaps impossible in practice.
The research was done both in Germany and Brazil and has shown that feeding neem to the bugs not only frees them of parasites but azadirachtin prevents the young insects from molting and the adults from reproducing.The researchers conclude that azadirachtin does not simply kill the parasite because they can dose it with azadirachtin and it remains infectious.
In any case they point out that the bug excretes most of the azadirachtin within a few minutes of eating it.Even with this short exposure however azadirachtin somehow disrupts the delicate hostparasite relationship.
According to the research leader The bug has been affected in such a fundamental way that it is no longer attractive to or a viable host for the parasite.Trypanosomes like these have always been extremely difficult to control.
Like the AIDS virus they constantly change their coat so that creating vaccines against them is difficult at best.
Whether neem will provide the key to their control is uncertain but at the very least it may be a valuable research tool for understanding the basis of the relationship between the host and the powerful parasite it passes on to millions of people.MALARIAPractitioners of the Indian Ayurveda medicine system have been preparing neem in oral doses for malarial patients for centuries.10 Neems antimalarial activity was reported in Ayurveda books as far back as 2000 B.C.
by Charaka and 1500 B.C.
by Sushruta.
Even outside Indiain Nigeria and Haiti for exampleneemleaf teas are used to treat malaria.10This is normally done by decocting or extracting about 500 g of leaves in alcohol or water.Page 66 ShareCiteSuggested Citation7   Medicinals.

SaveCancelPeople as PestsSticking forlornly out of the ground only five leaves left on its skimpy branches the seedling is dwarfed by the placard proclaiming its name and planting date Azadirachta indica 15 November 1986.
A neem tree.According to H.J.
von Maydells field guide Trees and Shrubs of the Sahel the neem is fastgrowing twothirds of the height to 20 meters may be reached after three years.
Photos from India show an evergreen with well leafed branches forming a thick canopy.
Yet this specimen in dryland Africa is barely one meter tall a twig holding grimly onto life in what should be the favorable environment of an agroforestry research station.What happened to that little thing asks a visitor.
The reply is revealing It got browsed by too many people.
It was planted as part of a trial but after a few months the farm manager noticed it wasnt growing.
Other trees around it were doing well so he knew it wasnt soil deficiency or lack of rain.
He thought it must be animals eating the leaves so he fenced it in with wire mesh.
There are dikdiks small antelopes and rabbits here and he concluded they really liked neem leaves.But the tree still didnt grow.
Finally he decided to watch and found farm workers were picking the leavesfor medicine.
In Kiswahili the tree is called mwarubaini which means 40 cures.
Its said to be able to cure 40 diseases and everybody wanted some of that medicine.
He had to order them not to touch the tree.And thats the only reason its still alive.Tom PawlickAgroforestry Today 1225In the past researchers were unable to confirm that neem products can affect the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
And it was not for want of trying.
Various groups researching antimalarials repeatedly tested neem.
The resultsin infected mice ducks and chickenswere inconsistent and usually negative.Nonetheless there is recent evidence that improper extraction methods may explain the earlier failures.
Certain extracts of neem leaf and neem seed have now proved effective against the malarial parasitePage 67 ShareCiteSuggested Citation7   Medicinals.

SaveCanceland the structure of one active component has been determined.11This compound gedunin is another limonoid.
It is said to be as effective as quinine on malariainfected cell cultures.
In India it was recently reported that components of the ethanol extract of neem leaves and seeds were effective against chloroquinesensitive and chloroquineresistant strains of the malaria parasite.12 Although all the different extracts tested suppressed the growth of parasites within 72 hours the most potent were the ethanol extracts of neem leaves and the mediumpolar extracts of neem seeds.Although these are preliminary results they indicate a potentially valuable line of research.
Malaria is creeping back into areas where it had been eliminated earlier this century.
It now infects approximately 110 million people annually causing up to 2 million deaths.
Moreover there is a growing problem of resistance to the conventional treatments.On the other hand caution is also needed.
As noted earlier anecdotal evidence from Nigeria suggests that drinking neemleaf teas over an extended period may lead to liver damage.PAIN RELIEF AND FEVER REDUCTIONNeem may also be a ready source of lowcost analgesic pain relieving or antipyretic feverreducing compounds.
It is used for these purposes everywhere it is grown.
In trials positive results have been obtained for significant analgesic antipyretic and antiinflammatory effects.
This may explain its wide use for treating fevers in general.
Some of the antiinflammatory compounds have even been patented.13BIRTH CONTROLResearch has shown that neem oil acts as a powerful spermicide.
This finding is preliminary and may eventually prove of little consequence but it may also prove of paramount importance.
Perhaps 80 percent of the expected population explosion which may double the number of people on earth in the next 40 years will occur in countries where neem can be grown.
An inexpensive birthcontrol method that can be produced in the backyards of even the remotest and poorest villages could be a vital resource.11Khalid et al.

SaveCancelNeem and Birth ControlScientists at Indias Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences DIPAS have isolated a neemoil extract Nim 76 that they believe can be refined into a new birth control method.
Their trials have found that neem oil is strongly spermicidal.
Rhesus monkey and human spermatozoa for example became totally immotile within 30 seconds of contacting the oil.Studies in 20 rats 8 rabbits 14 rhesus monkeys and 10 human volunteers showed that neem oil applied intravaginally before sexual intercourse prevented pregnancy.
Histopathological studies on the rat tissues vagina cervix and uterus showed no ill effects.
By contrast nonylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol the spermicide in a popular vaginal contraceptive cream produced obvious irritation.
Radioisotope studies indicated that neem oil was not absorbed from the vagina.DIPAS scientists maintain that neem oil might be an ideal contraceptive it is a natural product readily available inexpensive and nontoxic.
Moreover they anticipate that it will be widely accepted.
The only disadvantage they say is neem oils unpleasant odor.
However adding a small amount of scent masks most of the smell without reducing the spermicidal property.All in all they conclude neem oil has particular potential for widespread use by the poor.
It seems likely to be the cheapest contraceptive available and villagers in remote areas may well accept it as a regular method of birth control because sophisticated methods are financially beyond their reach and because they are extremely apprehensive about sterilization and other sophisticated methods.In a scientific article in the Indian Journal of Medical Research DIPAS researchers report that tests also show that Nim 76 can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the wall of the uterus.
Nim 76 was effective in rats and rabbits if applied on day 2 to day 7 of the expected pregnancy.
The minimum effective dose was very small only 25 1 for rats.
And a month after the applications ceased the animals were completely fertile again.
According to the researchers there were no deleterious effects on subsequent pregnancies or offspring see Appendix B page 104.Page 69 ShareCiteSuggested Citation7   Medicinals.

SaveCancelIndian scientists have demonstrated that neem oil is a potential new contraceptive for women see sidebar.
It kills spermatozoa within 30 seconds and has proved effective both in laboratory trials and in practicewhere an intravaginal dose of I ml of neem oil was used.
Histopathology failed to reveal any side effects.As a followup to these experiments the Indian army provided neem oil to 20 soldiers and their families as a birthcontrol measure.
This trial was considered so successful that the colonel in charge of the program was honored by the prime minister.
A neemoil formulation called Sensal is now sold in India for contraceptive purposes.Neemleaf extracts have also shown promise as male birthcontrol products because they reduce fertility in a variety of male mammals.
Reportedly there was no impotence or loss of libido.14More details of these tentative but potentially farreaching discoveries are given both in the sidebar opposite and in Appendix B.VETERINARY MEDICINEAncient practice and initial testing of neem derivatives against various livestock pests indicated that this is an area of particular promise for the future.
Some possibilities are discussed below.Controlling InsectsInsects of veterinary importance are obvious targets for neem products.
Some examples followMaggots Indians have traditionally crushed neem leaves and rubbed them into open wounds on cattle to eliminate maggots.Horn flies As noted in chapter 5 azadirachtin passes through the ruminant digestive tract and remains long enough that horn flies will not develop in the manure.Blowflies As also noted earlier neem oil and neemseed extract deterred the female blowfly Lucilia sericata from laying its eggs on sheep.
Moreover in Sri Lanka the oil is rubbed on cattle as a fly repellent.15Biting flies Azadirachtin also exerts an ovicidal effect in eggs of the bloodsucking fly Stomoxys calcitrans.1614Sadre et al.
1984.15Ganesalingham 1987.16Gill 1972.
In one trial neemkernel dust incorporated into the diet of the larvae resulted in 100 percent mortality within 2 days at a 10 percent treatment level.
At 5 percent treatment 91 percent of larvae died within 2 days and 100 percent mortality was reached in 7 days.Page 70 ShareCiteSuggested Citation7   Medicinals.

SaveCancelControlling BacteriaThe Staphylococcus aureus bacterium mentioned earlier also causes mastitis inflammation of the mammary glands in cows.
Neems apparent ability to control certain strains of this bacterium may thus be of great economic importance to dairying in the nations where neem grows.Also the salmonella bacterium in addition to affecting people causes abortion in horses cattle and sheep as well as a variety of infections in poultry and livestock.Controlling Intestinal WormsTrials in Germany showed that neem also works against intestinal nematodes in animals.17A WORD OF CAUTIONMedicines from plants should of course be treated with the same caution as medicines from laboratories.
Neem oil seems to be of particular concern.
Consuming it although widely practiced in parts of Asia is not recommended.
Doses as small as 5 ml have killed infants18 and animal studies showed acute toxicity at doses as low as 1424 ml per kg of body weight.19 It seems possible that this was caused by contaminants rather than by the oil itself.
In Germany toxicological tests using oil obtained from clean neem kernels resulted in no toxicity even at a concentration of 5000 mg per kg of body weight in rats.
Nonetheless caution is called for.The leaves or leaf extracts also should not be consumed by people or fed to animals over a long period.
There are anecdotal reports of renal failure in Ghanaians who were drinking leaf teas as a malaria treatment.None of this should be confused with earlier statements.
The compounds and seedkernel extracts responsible for the insecticidal activity appear to be essentially nontoxic to mammals see Appendix A.2017Information from H. Schmutterer.
To be effective the preparations had to have relatively high concentrations of azadirachtin.18Sinniah and Baskaran.

Neem A Tree For Solving Global Problems.Show detailsNational Research Council US Panel on Neem.Washington DC National Academies Press US 1992.ContentsHardcopy Version at National Academies PressSearch term  PrevNext  3The TreeNeem is a member of the mahogany family Meliaceae.
It is today known by the botanic name Azadirachta indica A. Juss.
In the past however it has been known by several names and some botanists formerly lumped it together with at least one of its relatives.
The result is that the older literature is so confusing that it is sometimes impossible to determine just which species is being discussed.1DESCRIPTIONNeem trees are attractive broadleaved evergreens that can grow up to 30 m tall and 2.5 m in girth.
Their spreading branches form rounded crowns as much as 20 m across.
They remain in leaf except during extreme drought when the leaves may fall off.
The short usually straight trunk has a moderately thick strongly furrowed bark.
The roots penetrate the soil deeply at least where the site permits and particularly when injured they produce suckers.
This suckering tends to be especially prolific in dry localities.Neem can take considerable abuse.
For example it easily withstands pollarding repeated lopping at heights above about 1.5 m and its topped trunk resprouts vigorously.
It also freely coppices repeated lopping at nearground level.
Regrowth from both pollarding and coppicing can be exceptionally fast because it is being served by a root system large enough to feed a fullgrown tree.The small white bisexual flowers are borne in axillary clusters.
They have a honey like scent and attract many bees.
Neem honey is popular and reportedly contains no trace of azadirachtin.The fruit is a smooth ellipsoidal drupe up to almost 2 cm long.
When ripe it is yellow or greenish yellow and comprises a sweet pulp enclosing a seed.
The seed is composed of a shell and a kernel sometimes two or three kernels each about half of the seeds weight.
It is the kernel that is used most in pest control.
The leaves also contain pesticidal ingredients but as a rule they are much less effective than those of the seed.A neem tree normally begins bearing fruit after 35 years becomes fully productive in 10 years and from then on can produce up to 50 kg of fruits annually.
It may live for more than two centuries.DISTRIBUTIONNeem is thought to have originated in Assam and Burma where it is common throughout the central dry zone and the Siwalik hills.
However the exact origin is uncertain some say neem is native to the whole Indian subcontinent others attribute it to dry forest areas throughout all of South and Southeast Asia including Pakistan Sri Lanka Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia.It is in India that the tree is most widely used.
It is grown from the southern tip of Kerala to the Himalayan hills in tropical to subtropical regions in semiarid to wet tropical regions and from sea level to about 700 m elevation.As already noted neem was introduced to Africa earlier this century see sidebar page 85.
It is now well established in at least 30 countries particularly those in the regions along the Saharas southern fringe where it has become an important provider of both fuel and lumber.
Although widely naturalized it has nowhere become a pest.
Indeed it seems rather well domesticated it appears to thrive in villages and towns.Over the last century or so the tree has also been established in Fiji Mauritius the Caribbean and many countries of Central and South America.In some cases it was probably introduced by indentured laborers who remembered its value from their days of living in Indias villages.
In other cases it has been introduced by foresters.
In the continental United States small plantings are prospering in southern Florida and exploratory plots have been established in southern California and Arizona.PROPAGATIONThe tree is easily propagatedboth sexually and vegetatively.
It can be planted using seeds seedlings saplings root suckers or tissue culture.
However it is normally grown from seed either planted directly on the site or transplanted as seedlings from a nursery.The seeds are fairly easy to prepare.
The fruit drops from the trees by itself the pulp when wet can be removed by rubbing against a coarse surface and after washing with water the clean white seeds are obtained.
In certain nationsTogo and Senegal for examplepeople leave the cleaning to the fruit bats and birds who feed on the sweet pulp and then spit out the seeds under the trees.It is reputed that neem seeds are not viable for long.
It is generally considered that after 26 months in storage they will no longer germinate.
However some recent observations of seeds that had been stored in France indicated that seeds without endocarp had an acceptable germinative capacity 42 percent after more than 5 years.2GROWTHThe tree is said to grow almost anywhere in the lowland tropics.
However it generally performs best in areas with annual rainfalls of 4001200 mm.
It thrives under the hottest conditions where maximum shade temperature may soar past 50C but it will not withstand freezing or extended cold.
It does well at elevations from sea level to perhaps 1000 m near the equator.
The taproot at least in young specimens may be as much as twice the height of the tree.Neem is renowned for good growth on dry infertile sites.
It performs better than most trees where soils are sterile stony and shallow or where there is a hardpan near the surface.
The tree also grows well on some acid soils.
Indeed it is said that the fallen neem leaves which are slightly alkaline pH 8.2 are good for neutralizing acidity in the soil.
On the other hand neem cannot stand wet feet and quickly dies if the site becomes waterlogged.Neem often grows rapidly.
It can be cut for timber after just 57 years.
Maximum yields reported from northern Nigeria Samaru amounted to 169 m3 of fuelwood per hectare after a rotation of 8 years.
Yields in Ghana were recorded between 108 and 137 m3 per hectare in the same time.Weeds seldom affect growth.
Except in the case of very young plants neem can dominate almost all competitors.
In fact the trees themselves may become weeds.
They spread widely under favorable site conditions since the seeds are distributed by birds bats and baboons.
For the same reason natural regeneration under old trees is often abundant.
But for all that in virtually every place it grows neem is considered a boon not a bane.
People almost always like to see more neems coming up.FigureNeem fruits.
The olive like fruits can occur in large numbers on the tree.
Animals like the fleshy outer part but the seed in the center is the source of the ingredients people use most.

In some parts of Africa mainly in the Lake Chad Basin a scale insect Aonidiella orientalis has become a serious pest.
This and other scale insects sometimes infest neem trees in central and south India.
They feed on sap and although they do little harm to mature trees they may kill young ones.
Now that one type has been detected in Africa the impact could be severe.4Other insect pests include the followingThe scale insect Pinnaspis strachani very common in Asia Africa and Latin AmericaLeafcutting ants Acromyrmex spp.
common defoliators of young neem trees in Central and South AmericaThe tortricid moth Adoxophyes aurata attacks leaves in Asia including Papua New GuineaThe bug Helopeltis theivora considered a serious neem pest in southern India andThe pyralid moth Hypsipyla sp.
attacks neem shoots in Australia.Even though neem timber is renowned for termite resistance termites sometimes damage or even kill the living trees.
They usually attack only sickly specimens however.DiseasesDespite the fact that the leaves contain fungicidal and antibacterial ingredients certain microbes may attack different parts of the tree including the followingRoots root rot Ganoderma lucidum for instanceStems and twigs the blight Corticium salmonicolor for exampleLeaves a leaf spot Cercospora subsessilis powdery mildew Oidium  sp.
and the bacterial blight Pseudomonas azadirachtae5 andSeedlings several blights rots and wiltsincluding Sclerotium Rhizoctonia and Fusarium.6A canker disease that discolors the wood and seems to coincide with a sudden absorption of water after long droughts has also been observed.
7Nutrient DeficienciesA lack of zinc or potassium drastically reduces growth.
Trees affected by zinc deficiency show chlorosis of the leaf tips and leaf margins their shoots exude much resin and their older leaves fall off.
Those with potassium deficiency show leaf tip and marginal chlorosis and die back necrosis.8Other ProblemsFire kills neem seedlings outright.
However mature trees almost always regrow especially if the dead parts are quickly cut away.High winds are a potential problem.
Large trees frequently snap off during hurricanes cyclones or typhoons.
Neem is therefore a poor candidate for planting in areas prone to such violent storms.Seedlings regenerating beneath stands of neem are sensitive to sudden exposure to intense sunlight.
Thus clearfelling neem trees normally produces a massive seedling kill especially if the seedlings are small.9In some localities rats and porcupines kill young trees by gnawing the bark around the base.
Even when not causing any physical damage rodents can be pests wherever they are numerous the fruits may disappear before the farmer can harvest them.Neem with its intensely bitter foliage is not a preferred browse but if nothing else is available goats and camels will eat it.
In fact in Asia goats and camels have been known to browse young neem trees so severely in times of scarcity that the plants died.10 In Africa neem is generally ignored by livestock which makes the tree easy to establish even within villages and courtyards.
The reason that livestock treat neem differently in Asia and Africa is unknown at present.
It may be differences in the tree specimens or in the animals preferences or past experiences.Footnotes1Previous botanic names were Melia indica and M. azadirachta.
The latter name not to mention neem itself has sometimes been confused with M. azedarach a West Asian tree commonly known as Persian lilac bakain dharak or chinaberry.
The taxonomy of all these closely related species is so complex that some botanists have recognized as many as 15 species others as few as 2.2Information from Y. Roederer and R. Bellefontaine.
Refrigeration is also said to extend the viability.3H.
Schmutterer.
1990.4It has been suggested that a drastic lowering of the groundwater level around Lake Chadwhich nearly dried out during a drought in the Sahelwas the main reason for the outbreak.
This is perhaps true scale insects are usually secondary pests that multiply best on plants that are already damaged by other pests or other adverse environmental factors.5Bakshi 1976 Desai et al.
1966.6Sankaram et al.
1987.7Information from J. Gorse.8Zech 1984.9Information from R.W.
Fishwick.10Indeed leaves could be used as a reserve fodder for camels sheep and goats.
Despite their repellent bitterness the leaves have a low fiber content and a high nutritional value 15 percent protein comparable to that of leguminous leaves.
However there are also records of toxic effects of neem leaves on goats Sudan.Copyright  National Academy of Sciences.Bookshelf ID NBK234651Contents PrevNext ShareViewsPubReaderPrint ViewCite this PageNational Research Council US Panel on Neem.

These civilizations along with ancient Egypt were considered the Cradles of Civilization circa 2600  1900 BC.
Nearly 5000 years ago the Neem tree was being used for its medicinal properties in households in these South Asian countries.
The earliest writings of using Neem in daily life was first recorded in Sanskrit in the ancient Indian scriptures of traditional medicine called the Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita.For centuries Indians planted the Neem tree in the vicinity of their homes and used its leaves branches and oil for daily Ayurveda medicinal practices.
Its small branches were chewed on to keep teeth and mouths clean of bacteria and gum disease.
For women in particular Neem proved an invaluable source of health hygiene and beauty that was freely available.
Having a bath steeped in Neem leaves kept their skin supple and healthy.
Neem leaf powder or crushed leaves incorporated into their face packs provided emollient and antiaging action.
The antiseptic properties of Neem leaf extracts helped in controlling pimples and acne.The Neem tree has a rich history and incredible variety of beneficial properties.
Every part of the tree contains some level of active compounds which have been found to be useful in organic and natural cosmetics medicine and agriculture.Neem Oil is derived from the seeds of the Neem fruit.
Neem Oil and Neem leaves are the most common forms in which Neem is used since they are renewable.
Harvesting the Neem Oil and leaves does not harm the fastgrowing tree.
Steeped in the traditions of time Neem is becoming indispensable to thoselooking for an effective natural remedy.JustNeem usesAfrican Neem harvested from our Neem Tree Orchard in Mauritania Africa and there is a reason for that.
The Companys orchard of highpotency Neem trees is a resource and benefit that other producers of Neembased skin care products do not have.Early on JustNeem commissioned scientific research to identify the various strains of the Neem tree.
One strain was found to have special characteristics including about 40 more potency than any others tested.
That highpotency Neem tree was found among the Neem trees in West Africa.
Dr. Radtke then identified a special location nearby and established a Neem tree orchard with only those highpotency Neem trees.In planning and developing the orchard we worked collaboratively with local villagers and nonprofit organizations to assure our orchard and our work there would help protect the environment and improve the lives of local villagers through better nutrition education health care and economic development.The Science of NeemNeem has stood the test of time.
And now researchers have begun systematically laying out the process of how it all works.
Researchers have isolated around 150 of Neems compounds or Neems powerful blend.
Imagine 150 different compounds working together to protect the Neem tree from bacteria fungus bugs and other threats found in nature One of Neems incredible advantages is this complexity of its compounds.The Neem tree has more than 100 healing properties that are excellent for skin care specifically for problem skin conditions like psoriasis eczema rosacea or acne.
Neem is super potent and should not be used in its raw form.
JustNeem addresses this by infusing it into a vast line of skin care products which gives Neem a vehicle to nourish your skin.Neem oil is the part of the Neem tree that is most discussed in online articles and in research reports.
Coldpressed Neem oil is a dark brown oil somewhat viscous that hardens at or below room temperature.
It has a strong herbal if not garlicky smell that makes it hard to use for skincare without the help of other complimentary oils that mask its natural smell.Read more about the Science of Neem on our Blog.Share About Neem Choose Your PlatformAll products found on JustNeems website are intended for topical use only.
