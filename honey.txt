It is graded by color with the clear golden amber honey often fetching a higher retail price than the darker varieties.The flavor of a particular type of honey will vary based on the types of flower from which the nectar was harvested.Both raw and pasteurized forms of honey are available.
Raw honey is removed from the hive and bottled directly and as such will contain trace amounts of yeast wax and pollen.
Consuming local raw honey is believed to help with seasonal allergies due to repeated exposure to the pollen in the area.
Pasteurized honey has been heated and processed to remove impurities.Honey has high levels of monosaccharides fructose and glucose and it contains about 70 to 80 percent sugar which provides its sweetness.
Honey also has antiseptic and antibacterial properties.
Modern medical science has managed to find uses for honey in chronic wound management and combating infection.This MNT Knowledge Center article includes a brief history of honey in traditional medicine and explains some of its potential health benefits.Fast facts on honeyHoney is linked to woundhealing properties and antibacterial action.It has been used in medicine for over 5000 years.Honey can replace sugar in meals providing a healthier option.
However they can also add browning and excess moisture to a dish.Do not give honey to children under 12 months old.BenefitsModern science is finding evidence for many of the historical uses of honey.1 Healing wounds and burnsHoney has been consumed for thousands of years for its supposed health benefits.There have been some cases in which people have reported positive effects of using honey in treating wounds.A review published in The Cochrane Library indicated that honey might be able to help heal burns.
The lead author of the study said that topical honey is cheaper than other interventions notably oral antibiotics which are often used and may have other deleterious side effects.However there is a lack of evidence to fully support this claim.
In fact a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases concluded that applying medicalgrade honey to the wounds of patients has no advantage over normal antibiotics among patients undergoing dialysis.Honey should never be given to young infants as it can cause botulism a rare but severe type of food poisoning.2 Reducing the duration of diarrheaAccording to researchbased reviews on honey it has been shown to decrease the severity and duration of diarrhea.
Honey also promotes increased potassium and water intake which is particularly helpful when experiencing diarrhea.Research that took place in Lagos Nigeria suggests that honey has also shown the ability to block the actions of pathogens that commonly cause diarrhea.3 Preventing acid refluxRecent research has shown that honey can reduce the upward flow of stomach acid and undigested food by lining the esophagus and stomach.This has helped to reduce the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD.
GERD can cause inflammation acid reflux and heartburn.4 Fighting infectionsIn 2010 scientists from the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam reported in FASEB Journal that honeys ability to kill bacteria lies in a protein called defensin1.A more recent study in the European Journal of Clinical Microbiology  Infectious Diseases showed that a certain type of honey called Manuka honey can help prevent the bacteria Clostridium difficile from settling in the body.
C. difficile is known for causing severe diarrhea and sickness.Some studies have revealed that Manuka honey may even be effective for the treatment of MRSA infections.Dr.
Jenkins concludedManuka and other honeys have been known to have wound healing and antibacterial properties for some time.
But the way in which they act is still not known.
If we can discover exactly how Manuka honey inhibits MRSA it could be used more frequently as a firstline treatment for infections with bacteria that are resistant to many currently available antibiotics.Manuka honey may even help reverse bacterial resistance to antibiotics according to research presented in the journal Letters in Applied Microbiology.
This type of honey showed action against Ureaplasma urealyticum a bacteria that is resistant to many different antibiotics.A study published in the journal Pediatrics which compared honey to placebo in helping children with a cough during the night found that honey was superior.
The researchers concludedParents rated the honey products higher than the silan date extract for symptomatic relief of their childrens nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty due to URI upper respiratory infection.
Honey may be a preferable treatment for cough and sleep difficulty associated with childhood URI.In The Scientific World Journal researchers provided data confirming that natural honey was as effective as a eusol antiseptic solution in reducing wound infections.There is a great deal of evidence supporting the use of honey as a remedy for infection.Is Manuka honey really a superfoodClick here to discover more about Manuka honey.Read now5 Relieving cold and cough symptomsThe World Health Organization WHO recommends honey as a natural cough remedy.The American Academy of Pediatrics also recognizes honey as a treatment for a cough.However they advise that honey is not suitable for children under the age of one year.A 2007 study by Penn State College of Medicine suggested that honey reduced nighttime coughing and improved sleep quality in children with upper respiratory infection to a greater degree than the cough medicine dextromethorphan.6 Replacing added sugar in the dietHoneys sweet flavor makes it an ideal substitute for sugar in the diet.Added sugar in the diet provides excess calories with no nutritional benefit.
This can lead to an increased body weight which comes with an increased risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.Honey can be added to food and beverages to sweeten the taste without the negative health impact of added sugars.
However since honey is still a sweetener it is important to remain mindful of how much honey being is used.
Medicinal useHoney is a versatile ingredient with a range of medicinal uses.Honey has been used to treat a wide array of illnesses ailments and injuries.It can be mixed with other remedies and consumed or rubbed onto the skin.
Practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine have attempted to use honey as a remedy for the followingstressweaknesssleep disturbancevision problemsbad breathteething pain in children over a year oldcough and asthmahiccupsstomach ulcersdiarrhea and dysenteryvomitingbedwetting and frequent urinationhigh blood pressureobesityjaundicehangover reliefeczema and dermatitisburns cuts and woundsarthritisWhile not all uses of honey are confirmed as effective trying it as treatment will not make conditions any worse or cause harm.Honey is sometimes touted as a cosmetic solution for cracked dry pimply or clogged skin.HistoryCave paintings show that around 8000 years ago honey was first being used by humans although there was no evidence of humans keeping and cultivating colonies of bees until 2400 BC.Honey was a mainstay in the medical practices of many cultures for centuries.
Over 4000 years ago honey was used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine where it was thought to be effective in treating indigestion and imbalances in the body.Before its use by Ancient Egyptians honey was rubbed onto the skin to treat wounds and has been found in medicinal substances from over 5000 years ago.The beneficial properties of honey have been explored and studied in modern times and there is evidence to suggest that some parts of its historical reputation may hold truth.
PropertiesHoney contains negligible amounts of vitamins and minerals.According to the United States Department of Agriculture USDA National Nutrient Database one tablespoon of honey contains 64 calories 17.3 grams g of sugar and 0 g of fiber fat and protein.Choosing honey over refined and processed sugar may lead to longterm health benefits.
Honey is known to have antioxidant antimicrobial and soothing effects.It is made up of glucose fructose and minerals such as iron calcium phosphate sodium chloride potassium and magnesium.Below is a typical honey profile according to BeeSourceFructose 38.2 percentGlucose 31.3 percentMaltose 7.1 percentSucrose 1.3 percentWater 17.2 percentHigher sugars 1.5 percentAsh 0.2 percentOther 3.2 percentThe slightly acidic pH level of honey is what helps prevent the growth of bacteria while its antioxidant elements clean up free radicals that are linked to diseases.The physical properties of honey vary depending on the specific flora used in its production as well as its water content.DietExperimentation is key when substituting honey for sugar.
Baking with honey can cause excess browning and moisture.As a general rule use  cup of honey for every one cup of sugar reduce the liquid in the recipe by 2 tablespoons and lower the oven temperature by 25 Fahrenheit.Here are some quick tips for including honey in the dietUse honey to sweeten your dressings or marinades.Stir honey into coffee or tea.Drizzle honey on top of toast or pancakes.Mix honey into yogurt cereal or oatmeal for a more natural sweetener.Spread raw honey over whole grain toast and top with peanut butter.Alternatively try these healthy and delicious recipes developed by registered dietitiansBasil honey mango sorbetHoney Dijon vinaigrette with arugula pear and walnut saladGrilled fruit kebabsWhen stored in an airtight container honey has no expiry date.
RisksA persons overall eating pattern is most important in preventing disease and achieving good health.
It is better to eat a diet with variety than to concentrate on individual foods as the key to good health.Honey is still a form of sugar so intake should be moderate.
The American Heart Association AHA recommends that women get no more than 100 calories a day from added sugars and men no more than 150 calories a day.
This is equal to a little over two tablespoons for women and three tablespoons for men.It is recommended that infants under a year old do not consume honey.
Honey may contain botulinum endospores that cause infant botulism in very young children a rare but serious type of food poisoning that can result in paralysis.
Even pasteurized honey has a chance of containing these spores.However honey has a wide range of benefits.

Honey  Wikipedia Honey From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia  Jump to navigationJump to searchsweet food made by bees using nectar from blossomsFor other uses see Honey disambiguation.A jar of honey with a honey dipper and an American biscuitHoney in honeycombHoney is a sweet viscous food substance produced by bees and some related insects.1 Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants floral nectar or other insects aphid honeydew through regurgitation enzymatic activity and water evaporation.
Honey is stored in wax structures called honeycombs.12 The variety of honey produced by honey bees the genus Apis is the bestknown due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.3 Honey is collected from wild bee colonies or from hives of domesticated bees a practice known as beekeeping.Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose granulated sugar.45 It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener.4 Most microorganisms do not grow in honey so sealed honey does not spoil even after thousands of years.67Honey provides 46 calories in a serving of one tablespoon 15 ml equivalent to 1272kJ per 100g.8 Honey is generally safe9 but may have various potentially adverse effects or interactions upon excessive consumption existing disease conditions or use of prescription drugs.10Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity depicted in Valencia Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8000 years ago.1112Contents1 Formation2 Production2.1 Collection2.2 Preservation2.3 Adulteration2.4 Worldwide production3 Modern uses3.1 Food3.2 Fermentation4 Physical and chemical properties4.1 Phase transitions4.2 Rheology4.3 Electrical and optical properties4.4 Hygroscopy and fermentation4.5 Thermal characteristics4.6 Acid content and flavor effects5 Classification5.1 Floral source5.1.1 Blended5.1.2 Polyfloral5.1.3 Monofloral5.2 Honeydew honey5.3 Classification by packaging and processing5.4 Grading5.5 Indicators of quality6 Nutrition6.1 Sugar profile7 Medical7.1 Wounds and burns7.2 Antibiotic7.3 Cough7.4 Battery ingestion7.5 Other7.6 Health hazards7.6.1 Botulism7.6.2 Toxic honey8 History and culture8.1 Ancient times8.2 Folk medicine and wound research8.3 Religious significance9 See also10 References11 Bibliography12 External linksFormationedit A honey bee on calyx of goldenrod with its proboscis extended Thermal image of a honey bee center next to a fly bottom on a dandelion.
The bee emits a large amount of body heat especially where the wings attach.Honey is produced by bees collecting nectar for use as sugars consumed to support metabolism of muscle activity during foraging or to be stored as a longterm food supply.1314 During foraging bees access part of the nectar collected to support metabolic activity of flight muscles with the majority of collected nectar destined for regurgitation digestion and storage as honey.1315 In cold weather or when other food sources are scarce adult and larval bees use stored honey as food.14By contriving for bee swarms to nest in humanmade hives people have been able to semidomesticate the insects and harvest excess honey.
In the hive or in a wild nest the three types of bees area single female queen beea seasonally variable number of male drone bees to fertilize new queens20000 to 40000 female worker bees16Leaving the hive a foraging bee collects sugarrich flower nectar sucking it through its proboscis and placing it in its proventriculus honey stomach or crop which lies just fore of its food stomach.
The honey stomach holds  40 mg of nectar or approximately 50 of the bees unloaded weight which can require over a thousand flowers and more than an hour to fill.
The nectar generally begins with a water content of 7080.17 Salivary enzymes and proteins from the bees hypopharyngeal gland is added to the nectar to begin breaking down the sugars raising the water content slightly.
The forager bees then return to the hive where they regurgitate and transfer nectar to the hive bees.
The hive bees then use their honey stomachs to ingest and regurgitate the nectar forming bubbles between their mandibles repeatedly until it is partially digested.
The bubbles create a large surface area per volume and a portion of the water is removed through evaporation.18131519 Bee digestive enzymes  invertase amylase and diastase  hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose.1315 The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes passing the nectar from one bee to the next until the product reaches the honeycombs in storage quality.15 It is then placed in honeycomb cells and left unsealed while still high in water content about 5070 and natural yeasts which unchecked would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment.142021 Bees are one of the few insects that can generate large amounts of body heat thus the hive bees constantly regulate the hive temperature either heating with their bodies or cooling with water evaporation to maintain a fairly constant temperature in the honeystorage areas of around 35C 95F.
The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and evaporate water from the honey to a content around 18 raising the sugar concentration beyond the saturation point and preventing fermentation.1415 The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them.15 As removed from the hive by a beekeeper honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.14Another source of honey is from a number of wasp species such as the wasps Brachygastra lecheguana and Brachygastra mellifica which are found in South and Central America.
These species are known to feed on nectar and produce honey.22Some wasps such as the Polistes versicolor even consume honey themselves alternating between feeding on pollen in the middle of their lifecycles and feeding on honey which can better provide for their energy needs.23ProductioneditCollectionedit Sealed frame of honey Extraction from a honeycomb Filtering from a honeycombHoney is collected from wild bee colonies or from domesticated beehives.
On average a hive will produce about 65 pounds 29kg of honey per year.24  The honey is stored in honeycombs.
Wild bee nests are sometimes located by following a honeyguide bird.
The bees may first be pacified by using smoke from a bee smoker.
The smoke triggers a feeding instinct an attempt to save the resources of the hive from a possible fire making them less aggressive and the smoke obscures the pheromones the bees use to communicate.The honeycomb is removed from the hive and the honey may be extracted from that either by crushing or by using a honey extractor.
The honey is then usually filtered to remove beeswax and other debris.Before the invention of removable frames bee colonies were often sacrificed to conduct the harvest.
The harvester would take all the available honey and replace the entire colony the next spring.
Since the invention of removable frames the principles of husbandry lead most beekeepers to ensure that their bees  have enough stores to survive the winter either by leaving some honey in the beehive or by providing the colony with a honey substitute such as sugar water or crystalline sugar often in the form of a candyboard.
The amount of food necessary to survive the winter depends on the variety of bees and on the length and severity of local winters.A wide range of species other than humans are attracted to wild or domestic sources of honey.25PreservationeditBecause of its unique composition and chemical properties honey is suitable for longterm storage and is easily assimilated even after long preservation.
Honey and objects immersed in honey have been preserved for centuries.2627 The key to preservation is limiting access to humidity.
In its cured state honey has a sufficiently high sugar content to inhibit fermentation.
If exposed to moist air its hydrophilic properties pull moisture into the honey eventually diluting it to the point that fermentation can begin.citation neededLong shelf life of honey is attributed to an enzyme found in the stomach of bees.
The bees mix Glucose oxidase with expelled nectar they previously consumed which then creates two byproducts gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide responsible for honeys acidity and ability to suppress bacterial growth.6AdulterationeditAdulteration of honey is the addition of other sugars syrups or compounds into honey to change its flavor or viscosity make it cheaper to produce or increase the fructose content to stave off crystallization.
According to the Codex Alimentarius of the United Nations any product labeled as honey or pure honey must be a wholly natural product although different nations have their own laws concerning labeling.28 Adulteration of honey is sometimes used as a method of deception when buyers are led to believe that the honey is pure.
The practice was common dating back to ancient times when honey was sometimes blended with plant syrups like maple birch or sorghum and sold to unsuspecting customers.
Sometimes crystallized honey was mixed with flour or other fillers hiding the adulteration from buyers until the honey was liquefied.
In modern times the most common adulterationingredient became clear almostflavorless corn syrup which when mixed with honey is often very difficult to distinguish from unadulterated honey.29Isotope ratio mass spectrometry can be used to detect addition of corn syrup and cane sugar by the carbon isotopic signature.
Addition of sugars originating from corn or sugar cane C4 plants unlike the plants used by bees and also sugar beet which are predominantly C3 plants skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey30 but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins.
In an unadulterated honey the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match.
Levels as low as 7 of addition can be detected.31In the United States according to the National Honey Board32 an organization supervised by the United States Department of Agriculture33 honey stipulates a pure product that does not allow for the addition of any other substance... this includes but is not limited to water or other sweeteners.34Worldwide productioneditProduction of natural honey  2016Countrytonnes China490839 Turkey105532 United States73428 Russia69764 India61335 Ukraine59294World1786996Source FAOSTAT35In 2016 global production of honey was 1.8 million tonnes led by China with 27 of the world total table.35 Other major producers were Turkey United States Russia and India.35Modern useseditFoodeditOver its history as a food11 the main uses of honey are in cooking baking desserts such as mel i mat as a spread on bread as an addition to various beverages such as tea and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages.
Honey barbecue and honey mustard are other common flavors used in sauces.FermentationeditPossibly the worlds oldest fermented beverage dating to 9000 years ago36 mead honey wine is the alcoholic product made by adding yeast to the honeywater must followed by weeks or months of fermentation.373839 In modern mead production the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used.3738Primary fermentation usually takes 2856 days after which the must is placed in a secondary fermentation vessel for 69 months of aging.373839 Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors such as floral origin of the honey and its natural sugar and microorganism contents must water percentage pH additives used and strain of yeast among others.3840 Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen salt or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities there is no evidence that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality.37 Cell immobilization methods however proved effective for enhancing mead quality.38Mead varieties include drinks called metheglin with spices or herbs melomel with fruit juices such as grape specifically called pyment hippocras with cinnamon and sack mead high concentration of honey38 many of which have been developed as commercial products numbering in the hundreds in the United States as of 2014.40 Honey is also used to make mead beer called braggot.41Physical and chemical propertiesedit Crystallized honey The inset shows a closeup of the honey showing the individual glucose grains in the fructose mixture.The physical properties of honey vary depending on water content the type of flora used to produce it pasturage temperature and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains.
Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures.
At room temperature honey is a supercooled liquid in which the glucose will precipitate into solid granules.
This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.At the temperature of 20C density of honey typically ranges between 1.38 and 1.45kgl.42Phase transitionseditThe melting point of crystallized honey is between 40 and 50C 104 and 122F depending on its composition.
Below this temperature honey can be either in a metastable state meaning that it will not crystallize until a seed crystal is added or more often it is in a labile state being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously.43 The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars fructose to glucose.
Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose such as brassica honey  crystallize almost immediately after harvesting while honeys with a low percentage of glucose such as chestnut or tupelo honey do not crystallize.
Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals while others produce many small crystals.44Crystallization is also affected by water content because a high percentage of water inhibits crystallization as does a high dextrin content.
Temperature also affects the rate of crystallization with the fastest growth occurring between 13 and 17C 55 and 63F.
Crystal nuclei seeds tend to form more readily if the honey is disturbed by stirring shaking or agitating rather than if left at rest.
However the nucleation of microscopic seedcrystals is greatest between 5 and 8C 41 and 46F.
Therefore larger but fewer crystals tend to form at higher temperatures while smaller but morenumerous crystals usually form at lower temperatures.
Below 5C the honey will not crystallize thus the original texture and flavor can be preserved indefinitely.44Since honey normally exists below its melting point it is a supercooled liquid.
At very low temperatures honey does not freeze solid.
Instead as the temperatures become lower the viscosity of honey increases.
Like most viscous liquids the honey  becomes thick and sluggish with decreasing temperature.
At 20C 4F honey may appear or even feel solid but it continues to flow at very low rates.
Honey has a glass transition between 42 and 51C 44 and 60F.
Below this temperature honey enters a glassy state and  becomes an amorphous solid noncrystalline.4546Rheologyedit Pouring raw honey.
The sheetlike appearance of the flow is the result of high viscosity and low surface tension contributing to the stickiness of honey.4748The viscosity of honey is affected greatly by both temperature and water content.
The higher the water percentage the more easily honey flows.
Above its melting point however water has little effect on viscosity.
Aside from water content the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity with the exception of a few types.
At 25C 77F honey with 14 water content generally has a viscosity around 400 poise while a honey containing 20 water has a viscosity around 20 poise.
Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very slowly at first.
A honey containing 16 water at 70C 158F has a viscosity around 2 poise while at 30C 86F the viscosity is around 70 poise.
As cooling progresses honey becomes more viscous at an increasingly rapid rate reaching 600 poise around 14C 57F.
4950 However while honey is very viscous it has rather low surface tension of 5060 mJm2 thus the wettability of honey is on the same order as water glycerin or most other liquids.51 The high viscosity and wettability of honey lead to the phenomenon of stickiness which is a timedependent process in supercooled liquids between the glasstransition temperature Tg and the crystallinemelting temperature.52A few types of honey have unusual viscous properties.
Honeys from heather or manuka display thixotropic properties.
These types of honey enter a gellike state when motionless but then liquify when stirred.53Electrical and optical propertieseditBecause honey contains electrolytes in the form of acids and minerals it exhibits varying degrees of electrical conductivity.
Measurements of the electrical conductivity are used to determine the quality of honey in terms of ash content.50The effect honey has on light is useful for determining the type and quality.
Variations in the water content alter the refractive index of honey.
Water content can easily be measured with a refractometer.
Typically the refractive index for honey ranges from 1.504 at 13 water content to 1.474 at 25.
Honey also has an effect on polarized light in that it rotates the polarization plane.
The fructose gives a negative rotation while the glucose gives a positive one.
The overall rotation can be used to measure the ratio of the mixture.5054 Honey may vary in color between pale yellow and dark brown but other bright colors may occasionally be found depending on the source of the sugar harvested by the bees.55Hygroscopy and fermentationeditHoney has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air a phenomenon called hygroscopy.
The amount of water the honey absorbs is dependent on the relative humidity of the air.
Because honey contains yeast this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation which usually begins if the honeys water content rises much above 25.
Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own which may be due to other ingredients it contains.54Fermentation of honey usually occurs after crystallization because without the glucose the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of fructose acids and water providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth.
Honey that is to be stored at room temperature for long periods of time is often pasteurized to kill any yeast by heating it above 70C 158F.54Thermal characteristicsedit Creamed honey.
On the left is how it appears fresh but the honey on the right has been aged at room temperature for two years.
While still edible the Maillard reaction produces considerable differences in the color and flavor of the aged honey.Like all sugar compounds honey caramelizes if heated sufficiently becoming darker in color and eventually burns.
However honey contains fructose which caramelizes at lower temperatures than glucose.56 The temperature at which caramelization begins varies depending on the composition but is typically between 70 and 110C 158 and 230F.
Honey also contains acids which act as catalysts for caramelization.
The specific types of acids and their amounts play a primary role in determining the exact temperature.57 Of these acids the amino acids which occur in very small amounts play an important role in the darkening of honey.
The amino acids form darkened compounds called melanoidins during a Maillard reaction.
The Maillard reaction occurs slowly at room temperature taking from a few to several months to show visible darkening but speeds up dramatically with increasing temperatures.
However the reaction can also be slowed by storing the honey at colder temperatures.58Unlike many other liquids honey has very poor thermal conductivity of 0.5 WmK at 13 water content compared to 401 WmK of copper taking a long time to reach thermal equilibrium.59 Melting crystallized honey can easily result in localized caramelization if the heat source is too hot or if it is not evenly distributed.
However honey takes substantially longer to liquify when just above the melting point than at elevated temperatures.50 Melting 20kg of crystallized honey at 40C 104F can take up to 24 hours while 50kg may take twice as long.
These times can be cut nearly in half by heating at 50C 122F.
However many of the minor substances in honey can be affected greatly by heating changing the flavor aroma or other properties so heating is usually done at the lowest temperature possible for the shortest amount of time.60Acid content and flavor effectseditThe average pH of honey is 3.9 but can range from 3.4 to 6.1.61 Honey contains many kinds of acids both organic and amino.
However the different types and their amounts vary considerably depending on the type of honey.
These acids may be aromatic or aliphatic nonaromatic.
The aliphatic acids contribute greatly to the flavor of honey by interacting with the flavors of other ingredients.61Organic acids comprise most of the acids in honey accounting for 0.171.17 of the mixture with gluconic acid formed by the actions of an enzyme called glucose oxidase as the most prevalent.61 Other organic acids are minor consisting of formic acetic butyric citric lactic malic pyroglutamic propionic valeric capronic palmitic and succinic among many others.6162ClassificationeditThis section needs additional citations for verification.

August 2015 Learn how and when to remove this template messageHoney is classified by its floral source and divisions are made according to the packaging and processing used.
Also regional honeys are identified.
In the USA honey is also graded on its color and optical density by USDA standards graded on the Pfund scale which ranges from 0 for water white honey to more than 114 for dark amber honey.63Floral sourceeditGenerally honey is classified by the floral source of the nectar from which it was made.
Honeys can be from specific types of flower nectars or can be blended after collection.
The pollen in honey is traceable to floral source and therefore region of origin.
The rheological and melissopalynological properties of honey can be used to identify the major plant nectar source used in its production.64BlendededitMost commercially available honey is blended65 meaning it is a mixture of two or more honeys differing in floral source color flavor density or geographic origin.66PolyfloraleditPolyfloral honey also known as wildflower honey67 is derived from the nectar of many types of flowers.6668The taste may vary from year to year and the aroma and the flavor can be more or less intense depending on which bloomings are prevalent.6669MonofloraleditMonofloral honey is made primarily from the nectar of one type of flower.
Different monofloral honeys have a distinctive flavor and color because of differences between their principal nectar sources.70 To produce monofloral honey beekeepers keep beehives in an area where the bees have access to only one type of flower.
In practice because of the difficulties in containing bees a small proportion of any honey will be from additional nectar from other flower types.71 Typical examples of North American monofloral honeys are clover orange blossom blueberry sage tupelo buckwheat fireweed mesquite and sourwood.
Some typical European examples include thyme thistle heather acacia dandelion sunflower lavender honeysuckle and varieties from lime and chestnut trees.citation needed In North Africa e.g.
Egypt examples include clover cotton and citrus mainly orange blossoms.citation needed The unique flora of Australia yields a number of distinctive honeys with some of the most popular being yellow box blue gum ironbark bush mallee Tasmanian leatherwood and macadamia.Honeydew honeyeditInstead of taking nectar bees can take honeydew the sweet secretions of aphids or other plant sapsucking insects.
Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color with a rich fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam and is not as sweet as nectar honeys.70 Germanys Black Forest is a well known source of honeydewbased honeys as well as some regions in Bulgaria Tara mountain in Serbia and Northern California in the United States.
In Greece pine honey a type of honeydew honey constitutes 6065 of the annual honey production.72 Honeydew honey is popular in some areas but in other areas beekeepers have difficulty selling the strongerflavored product.73The production of honeydew honey has some complications and dangers.
This honey has a much larger proportion of indigestibles than light floral honeys thus causing dysentery to the beescitation needed resulting in the death of colonies in areas with cold winters.
Good beekeeping management requires the removal of honeydew prior to winter in colder areas.
Bees collecting this resource also have to be fed protein supplements as honeydew lacks the proteinrich pollen accompaniment gathered from flowers.Classification by packaging and processingeditGenerally honey is bottled in its familiar liquid form.
However honey is sold in other forms and can be subjected to a variety of processing methods.A honeycombA variety of honey flavors and container sizes and styles from the 2008 Texas State FairCrystallized honey occurs when some of the glucose content has spontaneously crystallized from solution as the monohydrate.
It is also called granulated honey or candied honey.
Honey that has crystallized or commercially purchased crystallized can be returned to a liquid state by warming.74Pasteurized honey has been heated in a pasteurization process which requires temperatures of 161F 72C or higher.
Pasteurization destroys yeast cells.
It also liquefies any microcrystals in the honey which delays the onset of visible crystallization.
However excessive heat exposure also results in product deterioration as it increases the level of hydroxymethylfurfural HMFcitation needed and reduces enzyme e.g.
diastase activity.
Heat also affects appearance darkens the natural honey color taste and fragrance.75Raw honey is as it exists in the beehive or as obtained by extraction settling or straining without adding heat although some honey that has been minimally processed is often labeled as raw honey.76 Raw honey contains some pollen and may contain small particles of wax.Strained honey has been passed through a mesh material to remove particulate material77 pieces of wax propolis other defects without removing pollen minerals or enzymes.Filtered honey of any type has been filtered to the extent that all or most of the fine particles pollen grains air bubbles or other materials normally found in suspension have been removed.78 The process typically heats honey to 150170F 6677C to more easily pass through the filter.79 Filtered honey is very clear and will not crystallize as quickly79 making it preferred by the supermarket trade.80Ultrasonicated honey has been processed by ultrasonication a nonthermal processing alternative for honey.
When honey is exposed to ultrasonication most of the yeast cells are destroyed.
Those cells that survive sonication generally lose their ability to grow which reduces the rate of honey fermentation substantially.
Ultrasonication also eliminates existing crystals and inhibits further crystallization in honey.
Ultrasonically aided liquefaction can work at substantially lower temperatures around 95F 35C and can reduce liquefaction time to less than 30 seconds.81Creamed honey also called whipped honey spun honey churned honey honey fondant and in the UK set honey has been processed to control crystallization.
Creamed honey contains a large number of small crystals which prevent the formation of larger crystals that can occur in unprocessed honey.
The processing also produces a honey with a smooth spreadable consistency.82Dried honey has the moisture extracted from liquid honey to create completely solid nonsticky granules.
This process may or may not include the use of drying and anticaking agents.83 Dried honey is used in baked goods83 and to garnish desserts.84Comb honey is still in the honeybees wax comb.
It is traditionally collected using standard wooden frames in honey supers.
The frames are collected and the comb is cut out in chunks before packaging.
As an alternative to this laborintensive method plastic rings or cartridges can be used that do not require manual cutting of the comb and speed packaging.
Comb honey harvested in the traditional manner is also referred to as cutcomb honey.741385Chunk honey is packed in widemouth containers consisting of one or more pieces of comb honey immersed in extracted liquid honey.7413Honey decoctions are made from honey or honey byproducts which have been dissolved in water then reduced usually by means of boiling.
Other ingredients may then be added.
For example abbamele has added citrus.
The resulting product may be similar to molasses.Bakers honey is outside the normal specification for honey due to a foreign taste or odor or because it has begun to ferment or has been overheated.
It is generally used as an ingredient in food processing.
Additional requirements exist for labeling bakers honey including that it may not be sold labelled simply as honey.86GradingeditSee also Food gradingIn the US honey grading is performed voluntarily USDA does offer inspection and grading as online inplant or lot inspection...upon application on a feeforservice basis.
based upon USDA standards.
Honey is graded based upon a number of factors including water content flavor and aroma absence of defects and clarity.
Honey is also classified by color though it is not a factor in the grading scale.87The honey grade scale isGradeSoluble solidsFlavor and aromaAbsence of defectsClarityA 81.4Goodhas a good normal flavor and aroma for the predominant floral source or when blended a good flavor for the blend of floral sources and the honey is free from caramelized flavor or objectionable flavor caused by fermentation smoke chemicals or other causes with the exception of the predominant floral sourcePractically freecontains practically no defects that affect the appearance or edibility of the productClearmay contain air bubbles which do not materially affect the appearance of the product and may contain a trace of pollen grains or other finely divided particles of suspended material which do not affect the appearance of the productB 81.4Reasonably goodhas a reasonably good normal flavor and aroma for the predominant floral source or when blended a reasonably good flavor for the blend of floral sources and the honey is practically free from caramelized flavor and is free from objectionable flavor caused by fermentation smoke chemicals or other causes with the exception of the predominant floral sourceReasonably freemay contain defects which do not materially affect the appearance or edibility of the productReasonably clearmay contain air bubbles pollen grains or other finely divided particles of suspended material which do not materially affect the appearance of the productC 80.0Fairly goodhas a fairly good normal flavor and aroma for the predominant floral source or when blended a fairly good flavor for the blend of floral sources and the honey is reasonably free from caramelized flavor and is free from objectionable flavor caused by fermentation smoke chemicals or other causes with the exception of the predominant floral sourceFairly freemay contain defects which do not seriously affect the appearance or edibility of the productFairly clearmay contain air bubbles pollen grains or other finely divided particles of suspended material which do not seriously affect the appearance of the productSubstandardFails Grade CFails Grade CFails Grade CFails Grade COther countries may have differing standards on the grading of honey.
India for example certifies honey grades based on additional factors such as the Fiehes test and other empirical measurements.88Indicators of qualityeditHighquality honey can be distinguished by fragrance taste and consistency.
Ripe freshly collected highquality honey at 20C 68F should flow from a knife in a straight stream without breaking into separate drops.89 After falling down the honey should form a bead.
The honey when poured should form small temporary layers that disappear fairly quickly indicating high viscosity.
If not it indicates excessive water content over 2089of the product.
Honey with excessive water content is not suitable for longterm preservation.90In jars fresh honey should appear as a pure consistent fluid and should not set in layers.
Within a few weeks to a few months of extraction many varieties of honey crystallize into a creamcolored solid.
Some varieties of honey including tupelo acacia and sage crystallize less regularly.
Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of 4049C 104120F to delay or inhibit crystallization.
Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels for instance diastase activity which can be determined with the Schade or the Phadebas methods.
A fluffy film on the surface of the honey like a white foam or marblecolored or whitespotted crystallization on a containers sides is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.A 2008 Italian study determined nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between different honey types and can be used to pinpoint the area where it was produced.
Researchers were able to identify differences in acacia and polyfloral honeys by the differing proportions of fructose and sucrose as well as differing levels of aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine.
This ability allows greater ease of selecting compatible stocks.91NutritioneditHoneyNutritional value per 100g 3.5ozEnergy1272kJ 304kcalCarbohydrates82.4 gSugars82.12 gDietary fiber0.2 gFat0 gProtein0.3 gVitaminsQuantity DVRiboflavin B23 0.038 mgNiacin B31 0.121 mgPantothenic acid B51 0.068 mgVitamin B62 0.024 mgFolate B91 2 gVitamin C1 0.5 mgMineralsQuantity DVCalcium1 6 mgIron3 0.42 mgMagnesium1 2 mgPhosphorus1 4 mgPotassium1 52 mgSodium0 4 mgZinc2 0.22 mgOther constituentsQuantityWater17.10 gFull Link to USDA Database entryUnitsg  micrograms mg  milligramsIU  International unitsPercentages are roughly approximated using USrecommendations for adults.In a 100gram serving honey provides 304 kilocalories with no essential nutrients in significant content.8 Composed of 17 water and 82 carbohydrates honey has low content of fat dietary fiber and protein.Sugar profileeditA mixture of sugars and other carbohydrates honey is mainly fructose about 38 and glucose about 324 with remaining sugars including maltose sucrose and other complex carbohydrates.4 Its glycemic index ranges from 31 to 78 depending on the variety.92 The specific composition color aroma and flavor of any batch of honey depend on the flowers foraged by bees that produced the honey.11One 1980 study found that mixed floral honey from several United States regions typically contains93Fructose 38.2Glucose 31.3Maltose 7.1Sucrose 1.3Water 17.2Higher sugars 1.5Ash 0.2Otherundetermined 3.2A 2013 NMR spectroscopy study of 20 different honeys from Germany found that their sugar contents comprisedFructose 28 to 41Glucose 22 to 35The average ratio was 56 fructose to 44 glucose but the ratios in the individual honeys ranged from a high of 64 fructose and 36 glucose one type of flower honey table 3 in reference to a low of 50 fructose and 50 glucose a different floral source.
This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose galactose and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and glucose.94MedicaleditWounds and burnseditSome evidence shows that sterilized honey may help healing in skin wounds after surgery and mild partial thickness burns when used in a dressing but in general the evidence for the use of honey in wound treatment is of such low quality that firm conclusions cannot be drawn.9596 Evidence does not support the use of honeybased products in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers or ingrown toenail.9798AntibioticeditComponents of honey under preliminary research for their potential antibacterial properties include methylglyoxal hydrogen peroxide and royalisin also called defensin1.99100CougheditFor chronic and acute coughs a Cochrane review found no strong evidence for or against the use of honey.101102 For treating children the systematic review concluded with moderate to low evidence that honey probably helps more than no treatment diphenhydramine and placebo at giving relief from coughing.102 Honey does not appear to work better than dextromethorphan at relieving coughing in children.102The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends avoiding giving over the counter cough and common cold medication to children under six and suggests a homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take but warns that honey should not be given to babies because of the risk of infant botulism.103 The World Health Organization recommends honey as a treatment for coughs and sore throats including for children stating that no reason exists to believe it is less effective than a commercial remedy.104 Honey is recommended by one Canadian physician for children over the age of one for the treatment of coughs as it is deemed as effective as dextromethorphan and more effective than diphenhydramine.9Battery ingestioneditThe use of honey has been recommended as a temporary intervention for known or suspected button cell ingestions to reduce the risk and severity of injury to the esophagus caused by the battery prior to its removal.105106OthereditNo evidence shows the benefit of using honey to treat cancer10 although honey may be useful for controlling side effects of radiation therapy or chemotherapy applied in cancer treatment.107Consumption is sometimes advocated as a treatment for seasonal allergies due to pollen but  scientific evidence to support the claim is inconclusive.10108 Honey is generally considered ineffective for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.10109Although the majority of calories in honey is from fructose honey does not cause increased weight gain110 and fructose by itself is not an independent factor for weight gain.111Health hazardseditAlthough honey is generally safe when taken in typical food amounts109 there are various potential adverse effects or interactions it may have in combination with excessive consumption existing disease conditions or drugs.10 Included among these are mild reactions to high intake such as anxiety insomnia or hyperactivity in about 10 of children according to one study.9 No symptoms of anxiety insomnia or hyperactivity were detected with honey consumption compared to placebo according to another study.9 Honey consumption may interact adversely with existing allergies high blood sugar levels as in diabetes or anticoagulants used to control bleeding among other clinical conditions.10People who have a weakened immune system may be at risk of bacterial or fungal infection from eating honey112 although there is no highquality clinical evidence that this occurs commonly.10BotulismeditInfants can develop botulism after consuming honey contaminated with Clostridium botulinum endospores.113Infantile botulism shows geographical variation.
In the UK only six cases have been reported between 1976 and 2006114 yet the U.S. has much higher rates 1.9 per 100000 live births 47.2 of which are in California.115 While the risk honey poses to infant health is small taking the risk is not recommended until after one year of age and then giving honey is considered safe.116Toxic honeyeditMain article Bees and toxic chemicals Toxic honey A honey bee collecting nectar from monkshood Aconitum delphinifolium or wolfs bane an extremely toxic plant.
The flowers are shaped in such a way that the bee must fit its entire body into the flower to reach the nectar.Mad honey intoxication is a result of eating honey containing grayanotoxins.117 Honey produced from flowers of rhododendrons mountain laurels sheep laurel and azaleas may cause honey intoxication.
Symptoms include dizziness weakness excessive perspiration nausea and vomiting.
Less commonly low blood pressure shock heart rhythm irregularities and convulsions may occur with rare cases resulting in death.
Honey intoxication is more likely when using natural unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives.
Commercial processing with pooling of honey from numerous sources is thought to dilute any toxins.118Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to tutu bushes Coriaria arborea and the vine hopper insect Scolypopa australis.
Both are found throughout New Zealand.
Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant.
This introduces the poison tutin into honey.119 Only a few areas in New Zealand the Coromandel Peninsula Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Marlborough Sounds frequently produce toxic honey.
Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting delirium giddiness increased excitability stupor coma and violent convulsions.medical citation needed To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand.
Since December 2001 New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu vine hopper and foraging conditions within 3km 1.9mi of their apiary.citation needed Intoxication is rarely dangerous.117History and cultureeditHoney use and production has a long and varied history.11 In many cultures honey has associations that go beyond its use as a food.
It is frequently used as a talisman and symbol of sweetness.120Ancient timesedit Honey seeker depicted in an 8000yearold cave painting at Araa Caves in SpainHoney collection is an ancient activity.12 Humans apparently began hunting for honey at least 8000 years ago as evidenced by a cave painting in Valencia Spain.12 The painting is a Mesolithic rock painting showing two honey hunters collecting honey and honeycomb from a wild bee nest.
The figures are depicted carrying baskets or gourds and using a ladder or series of ropes to reach the wild nest.The greater honeyguide bird guides humans to wild bee hives121 and this behavior may have evolved with early hominids.122123The oldest known honey remains were found in the country of Georgia.
Archaeologists found honey remains on the inner surface of clay vessels unearthed in an ancient tomb dating back some 47005500 years.124125126 In ancient Georgia several types of honey were buried with a person for their journey into the afterlife including linden berry and meadowflower varieties.127In ancient Egypt honey was used to sweeten cakes and biscuits and was used in many other dishes.
Ancient Egyptian and Middle Eastern peoples also used honey for embalming the dead.128 The fertility god of Egypt Min was offered honey.In ancient Greece honey was produced from the Archaic to the Hellenistic periods.
In 594 BC129 beekeeping around Athens was so widespread that Solon passed a law about it He who sets up hives of bees must put them 300 feet 91 metres away from those already installed by another.1303 Greek archaeological excavations of pottery located ancient hives.131 According to Columella Greek beekeepers of the Hellenistic period did not hesitate to move their hives over rather long distances to maximise production taking advantage of the different vegetative cycles in different regions.131In the absence of sugar honey was an integral sweetening ingredient in Greek and Roman cuisine.
During Roman times honey was part of many recipes and it is mentioned in the work of many authors such as Virgil Pliny Cicero and others.citation neededThe spiritual and therapeutic use of honey in ancient India is documented in both the Vedas and the Ayurveda texts which were both composed at least 4000 years ago.132Beekeeping in ancient China has existed since ancient times and appears to be untraceable to its origin.
In the book Golden Rules of Business Success written by Fan Li or Tao Zhu Gong during the Spring and Autumn period some parts mention the art of beekeeping and the importance of the quality of the wooden box for beekeeping that can affect the quality of its honey.citation neededHoney was also cultivated in ancient Mesoamerica.
The Maya used honey from the stingless bee for culinary purposes and continue to do so today.
The Maya also regard the bee as sacred see Mayan stingless bees of Central America.Some cultures believed honey had many practical health uses.
It was used as an ointment for rashes and burns and to help soothe sore throats when no other practices were available.Folk medicine and wound researcheditIn myths and folk medicine honey has been used both orally and topically to treat various ailments including gastric disturbances ulcers skin wounds and skin burns by ancient Greeks and Egyptians and in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine.132Proposed for treating wounds and burns honey may have antimicrobial properties as first reported in 1892 and be useful as a safe improvisational wound treatment.133134 Though its supposed antimicrobial properties may be due to high osmolarity even when diluted with water it is more effective than plain sugar water of a similar viscosity.133134 Definitive clinical conclusions about the efficacy and safety of treating wounds however are not possible from this limited research.95The flora that bees use to make the honey may have a role in its properties particularly by bees foraging from the manuka myrtle  Leptospermum scoparium as proposed in one study.133Religious significanceeditAncient Greek ReligionIn ancient Greek religion the food of Zeus and the 12 Gods of Olympus was honey in the form of nectar and ambrosia.135HinduismIn Hinduism honey Madhu is one of the five elixirs of immortality Panchamrita.
In temples honey is poured over the deities in a ritual called Madhu abhisheka.
The Vedas and other ancient literature mention the use of honey as a great medicinal and health food.136JudaismIn Jewish tradition honey is a symbol for the new year Rosh Hashanah.
At the traditional meal for that holiday apple slices are dipped in honey and eaten to bring a sweet new year.
Some Rosh Hashanah greetings show honey and an apple symbolizing the feast.
In some congregations small straws of honey are given out to usher in the new year.137The Hebrew Bible contains many references to honey.
In the Book of Judges Samson found a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of a lion 148.
In Old Testament law offerings were made in the temple to God.
The Book of Leviticus says that Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast for you are not to burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord 211.
In the Books of Samuel Jonathan is forced into a confrontation with his father King Saul after eating honey in violation of a rash oath Saul has made.138 Proverbs 1624 in the JPS Tanakh 1917 version says Pleasant words are as a honeycomb Sweet to the soul and health to the bones.
Book of Exodus famously describes the Promised Land as a land flowing with milk and honey 333.

was found in Tel Rehov Israel that contained 100 hives and is estimated to produce half a ton of honey annually.140141 Pure honey is considered kosher though it is produced by a flying insect a nonkosher creature other products of nonkosher animals are not kosher.142BuddhismIn Buddhism honey plays an important role in the festival of Madhu Purnima celebrated in India and Bangladesh.
The day commemorates Buddhas making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness.
The legend has it that while he was there a monkey brought him honey to eat.
On Madhu Purnima Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to monks.
The monkeys gift is frequently depicted in Buddhist art.136ChristianityIn the Christian New Testament Matthew 34 John the Baptist is said to have lived for a long period of time in the wilderness on a diet consisting of locusts and wild honey.IslamIn Islam  an entire chapter Surah in the Quran is called anNahl the Bees.
According to his teachings hadith Muhammad strongly recommended honey for healing purposes.143 The Quran promotes honey as a nutritious and healthy food.
Below is the English translation of those specific versesAnd thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills on trees and in mens habitations Then to eat of all the produce of the earth and find with skill the spacious paths of its Lord there issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours wherein is healing for men verily in this is a Sign for those who give thought AlQuran 166869.144See alsoeditFood portalBee breadHoney huntingList of spreadsMore than Honeya 2012 Swiss documentary film on the current state of honey bees and beekeepingNational Honey ShowRoyal jellyReferencesedit a b Crane E 1990.

10 Surprising Health Benefits of Honey NewsletterNUTRITIONEvidence Based10 Surprising Health Benefits of HoneyWritten by Kris Gunnars BSc on June 15 2017Since ancient times honey has been used as both a food and a medicine.
Its very high in beneficial plant compounds and offers several health benefits.
Honey is particularly healthy when used instead of refined sugar which is 100 empty calories.
Here are the top 10 health benefits of honey that are supported by science.
1.
Honey Contains Some Nutrients Honey is a sweet thick liquid made by honeybees.
The bees swarm their environment and collect the sugarrich nectar of flowers 1.
Then inside the beehive they repeatedly consume digest and regurgitate vomit the nectar.
The end product is honey a liquid that is supposed to serve as stored food for the bees.
The smell color and taste depend on the types of flowers the bees visit.
Nutritionally 1 tablespoon of honey 21 grams contains 64 calories and 17 grams of sugar including fructose glucose maltose and sucrose.
It contains virtually no fiber fat or protein 2.
It also contains trace amounts under 1 of RDA of several vitamins and minerals but you would have to eat many pounds to fulfill your daily requirements.
Where honey shines is in its content of bioactive plant compounds and antioxidants.
Darker types tend to be even higher in these compounds than lighter types 3 4.
Bottom Line Honey is thick sweet liquid made by honeybees.
It is low in vitamins and minerals but may be high in some plant compounds.
2.
HighQuality Honey Is Rich in Antioxidants Highquality honey contains many important antioxidants.
These includes phenols enzymes and compounds like flavonoids and organic acids 5.
Scientists believe that it is the combination of these compounds that gives honey its antioxidant power 5.
Interestingly two studies have shown that buckwheat honey increases the antioxidant value of the blood 6 7.
Antioxidants have been linked to reduced risk of heart attacks strokes and some types of cancer.
They may also promote eye health 8.
Bottom Line Honey contains a number of antioxidants including phenolic compounds like flavonoids.
3.
Honey Is Less Bad Than Sugar for Diabetics The evidence on honey and diabetes is mixed.
On one hand it can help with some risk factors that are common in diabetics.
For example it lowers LDL cholesterol triglycerides and inflammation and raises HDL the good cholesterol 9 10 11.
However some studies have found that it can also increase blood sugar levels just not as much as refined sugar 10.
So while honey may be less bad than refined sugar for diabetics it is still something that diabetics should only consume with caution.
In fact diabetics may do best minimizing all highcarb foods 12.
Bottom Line Some studies show that honey improves heart disease risk factors in diabetics.
However it also raises blood sugar levels so it can not be considered diabeticfriendly.
4.
The Antioxidants in It Can Help Lower Blood Pressure Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease and honey may help lower it.
This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to blood pressure lowering effects 13.
Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey 14 15.
Bottom Line Eating honey may lead to modest reductions in blood pressure which is an important risk factor for heart disease.
5.
Honey Also Helps Improve Cholesterol Having high LDL cholesterol levels is an important risk factor for heart disease.
It plays a major role in atherosclerosis the fatty buildup in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.
Interestingly several studies have shown that honey can improve your cholesterol levels.
It reduces total and LDL cholesterol while significantly raising HDL the good cholesterol 9 10 11 16.
For example one study in 55 patients compared honey to table sugar.
It found that it caused a 5.8 reduction in LDL and a 3.3 increase in HDL.
It also caused weight loss of 1.3 compared to sugar 17.
Bottom Line Honey seems to have a positive effect on cholesterol levels.
It leads to modest reductions in total and LDL cholesterol while raising HDL.
6.
Honey Can Lower Triglycerides Elevated blood triglycerides are another major risk factor for heart disease.
They are also a key sign of insulin resistance a major driver of type 2 diabetes.
Triglyceride levels tend to increase on a diet that is high in sugar and refined carbs.
Interestingly multiple studies have linked regular honey consumption with lower triglyceride levels especially when it is used to replace sugar 9 10 11 16.
For example one study that compared honey and sugar found 1119 lower triglyceride levels in the honey group 17.
Bottom Line Elevated triglycerides are a risk factor for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
Several studies show that honey can lower triglyceride levels especially when it is being used to replace sugar.
7.
The Antioxidants in It Are Linked to Other Beneficial Effects on Heart Health Again honey is a rich source of phenols and other antioxidant compounds.
Many of these have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease 8.
They may help the arteries in the heart dilate increasing blood flow to the heart.
They may also help prevent the formation of blood clots which can lead to heart attacks and strokes 8.
Furthermore one study in rats showed that honey protected the heart from oxidative stress 18.
All this being said there is no longterm human study available on honey and heart health so take this with a grain of salt.
Bottom Line The antioxidants in honey have been linked to beneficial effects on heart health including increased blood flow to the heart and a reduced risk of blood clot formation.
8.
Honey Promotes Burn and Wound Healing Applying honey to the skin has been used to heal wounds and burns since ancient Egypt and is still being used today.
In one review from 2015 26 studies on honey and wound care were evaluated 19.
This review found that it is most effective at healing partial thickness burns and wounds that have become infected after surgery 19.
It is also an effective treatment for diabetic foot ulcers which are very serious complications and can lead to amputation 20 21.
One study reported a 43.3 success rate with honey as a wound treatment.
In another study topical honey healed a whopping 97 of patients being treated for their diabetic ulcers 21 22.
Researchers believe that its healing powers come from its antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects as well as its ability to nourish the surrounding tissue 23.
Whats more it can help treat other skin conditions including psoriasis hemorrhoids and herpes lesions 24 25 26.
Bottom Line When applied to the skin honey can be part of an effective treatment plan for burns wounds and many other skin conditions.
It is particularly effective for diabetic foot ulcers.
9.
Honey Can Help Suppress Coughs in Children Coughing is a common problem for children with upper respiratory infections.
It can affect sleep and quality of life for both the children and their parents.
However mainstream medications for cough are not always effective and can have side effects.
Interestingly honey may be a better choice.
The evidence shows that it is very effective 27 28.
One study found that it worked even better than two common cough medications 29.
Another study found that it reduced cough symptoms and improved sleep even more than cough medication 28.
Nevertheless it should never be given to children under 1 year of age due to the risk for botulism 30.
Bottom Line For children over one year of age honey can act as a natural and safe cough suppressant.
Some studies show that it is even more effective than cough medication.
10.
Its Delicious But Still High in Calories and Sugar Honey is a delicious healthier alternative to sugar.
Make sure to choose a highquality brand because some of the lowerquality ones may be adulterated with syrup.
Keep in mind that it should only be consumed in moderation as it is still high in calories and sugar.
The benefits of honey are most pronounced when it is replacing another unhealthier sweetener.
At the end of the day honey is simply a less bad sweetener than sugar and highfructose corn syrup.
