It is a tetraploid and selfpollinating species probably evolved from its wild relative Eleusine africana.2Finger millet is native to the Ethiopian and Ugandan highlands.3 Interesting crop characteristics of finger millet are the ability to withstand cultivation at altitudes over 2000 m above sea level its favorable micronutrient contents high iron and methionine content in particular its high drought tolerance and the long storage time of the grains.2Contents1 History2 Growing regions3 Climate requirements4 Cropping systems5 Weeds6 Diseases and pests7 Propagation and sowing8 Harvest9 Storage10 Processing10.1 Milling10.2 Malting11 Nutrition11.1 Growing finger millet to improve nutrition12 Preparation as food12.1 In India12.1.1 Konkan Region and Goa12.1.2 Maharashtra12.1.3 Karnataka12.1.4 Tamil Nadu12.1.5 Telangana12.1.6 Andhra Pradesh12.1.7 Kerala12.1.8 Central  Northern India12.2 In South and Far East Asia12.2.1 In Nepal12.2.2 In Sri Lanka12.2.3 In Vietnam12.3 As beverage13 Common names for finger millet14 Gallery15 References16 External linksHistoryeditFinger millet originated in East Africa Ethiopian and Ugandan highlands and came to India around 2000 BCE.
It has been found in an Indian archaeological site dated to 1800 BCE later Iron Age.4 In Sri Lanka it is known as kurakkan or kurahan   and is mentioned in legends of ancient kings.Growing regionseditMain cultivation areas are Eastern and Southern African countries Uganda Kenya Zaire Zimbabwe Zambia Sudan Tanzania Nigeria and Mozambique and Southern Asia mainly India and Nepal.2Climate requirementseditFinger millet is a shortday plant with a growing optimum 12 hours of daylight for most varieties.
Its main growing area ranges from 20N to 20S meaning mainly the semiarid to arid tropics.
Nevertheless finger millet is found to be grown at 30N in the Himalaya region India and Nepal.
It is generally considered as a droughttolerant crop but compared with other millets such as pearl millet and sorghum it preferes moderate rainfall 500mm annually.
The majority of worldwide finger millet farmers grow it rainfed although yields often can be significantly improved when irrigation is applied.
In India finger millet is a typical rabi dryseason crop.
Heat tolerance of finger millet is high.
For Ugandan finger millet varieties for instance the optimal average growth temperature ranges at about 27C while the minimal temperatures should not be lower than 18C.
Relative to other species pearl millet and sorghum finger millet has a higher tolerance to cool temperatures.
It is grown from about 500 to about 2400 m above sea level e.g.
in Himalaya region.
By that it can be cultivated on higher elevations than most tropical crops.
Finger millet can grow on various soils including highly weathered tropical lateritic soils.
Furthermore it can tolerate soil salinity up to a certain extent.
Its ability to bear waterlogging is limited so good drainage of the soils and moderate waterholding capacity are optimal.2 Finger millet can tolerate moderately acidic soils pH 5 but also moderately alkaline soils pH 8.2.5Cropping systemseditFinger millet monocrops grown under rainfed conditions are most common in drier areas of Eastern Africa.
In addition intercropping with legumes such as cowpea or pigeon pea are also quite common in East Africa.
Tropical Central Africa supports scattered regions of finger millet intercropping mostly with legumes but also with cassava plantain and vegetables.2Most common finger millet intercropping systems in South India are as follows6With legumes Finger milletdolichos finger milletpigeonpea finger milletblack gram finger milletcastorWith cereals Finger milletmaize finger milletfoxtail millet finger milletjowar finger milletlittle milletWith other species Finger milletbrassicas finger milletmustardWeedseditWeeds are the major biotic stresses for finger millet cultivation.
Its seeds are very small which leads to a relatively slow development in early growing stages.
This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light water and nutrients compared with weeds.7 In East and Southern Africa the closely related species Eleusine indica common name Indian goose grass is a severe weed competitor of finger millet.
Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied as often the case in East Africa the two species are very difficult to distinguish.2 Besides Eleusine indica the species Xanthium strumarium which is animal disperesed and the stolonowning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds.7 Measures to control weeds include cultural physical and chemical methods.
Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and E. indica easier when hand weeding.2 ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds.
Physical weed control in financial resourcelimited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a hand hoe.7Diseases and pestseditFinger millet is generally seen as not very prone to diseases and pests.
Nonetheless finger millet blast caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea anamorph Pyricularia grisea can locally cause severe damages especially when untreated.2 In Uganda yield losses up to 80 were reported in bad years.
The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves neck rots and ear rots.7 These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and grain filling so reduce yield and grain quality.
Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related E. indica E. africana Digitaria spp.
Setaria spp.
and Doctylocterium spp.78 Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures chemical treatments and the use of resistant varieties.
Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with nonhost crops such as  legumes deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to uninfected fields weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of  high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant.7 Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides such as trycyclozole.79Striga a parasitic weed which occurs naturally in parts of Africa Asia and Australia can severely affect the crop and yield losses in finger millet and other cereals by 20 to 80.10 Striga can be controlled with limited success by hand weeding herbicide application crop rotations improved soil fertility intercropping and biological control.11 The most economically feasible and environmentally friendly control measure would be to develop and use Strigaresistant cultivars.12 Striga resistant genes have not been identified yet in cultivated finger millet but could be found in crop wild relatives of finger millet.13 ICRISAT is currently evaluating crop wild relatives and will introgress Striga resistance into cultivated finger millet.Another pathogen of relevance in the finger millet cultivation is the fungus Helminthosporium nodulosum causing leaf blight.5Important finger millet pests are bird predators such as quelea in East Africa.2 The pink stem borer Sesamia inferens and the shoot fly Atherigona milliaceae are considered as the most relevant insect pests in finger millet cultivation.5 Measures to control Sesamia inferens are uprooting of infected plants destroying of stubbles having a crop rotation chemical control with insecticides biological measures such as pheromone traps or biological pest control with the use of antagonistic organisms e.g.
Sturmiopsis inferens.14Propagation and sowingeditPropagation in finger millet farming is done mainly by seeds.
In rainfed cropping four sowing methods are used15Broadcasting Seeds are directly sown in the field.
This is the common method because it is the easiest way and no special machinery is required.
The organic weed management with this method is a problem because it is difficult to distinguish between weed and crop.Line Sowing Improved sowing compared to broadcasting.
Facilitates organic weed management due to better distinction of weed and crop.
In this method spacing of 22cm to 30cm between lines and 8cm to 10cm within lines should be maintained.
The seeds should be sown about 3cm deep in the soil.Drilling in rows Seeds are sown directly in the untreated soil by using a directseed drill.
This method is used in conservation agriculture.Transplanting the seedlings Raising the seedlings in nursery beds and transplant to the main field.
Leveling and watering of beds is required during transplanting.
Seedlings with 4 weeks age should be transplanted in the field.
For early Rabi and Kharif season seedlings should be transplanted at 25cm x 10cm and for late Kharif season at 30cm x 10cm.
Planting should be done 3cm depth in the soilHarvesteditCrop does not mature uniformly and hence the harvest is to be taken up in two stages.
When the earhead on the main shoot and 50 of the earheads on the crop turn brown the crop is ready for the first harvest.
At the first harvest all earheads that have turned brown should be cut.
After this drying threshing and cleaning the grains by winnowing.
The second harvest is around seven days after the first.
All earheads including the green ones should be cut.
The grains should then be cured to obtain maturity by heaping the harvested earheads in shade for one day without drying so that the humidity and temperature increase and the grains get cured.
After this drying threshing and cleaning as after the first harvesting.2StorageeditOnce harvested the seeds keep extremely well and are seldom attacked by insects or moulds.
Finger millet can be kept for up to 10 years when it is unthreshed.
Some sources report a storage duration up to 50 years under good storage conditions.2 The long storage capacity makes finger millet an important crop in riskavoidance strategies as a famine crop for poor farming communities.2ProcessingeditMillingeditAs a first step of processing finger millet can be milled to produce flour.
However finger millet is difficult to mill due to the small size of the seeds and because the bran is bound very tightly to the endosperm.
Furthermore the delicate seed can get crushed during the milling.
The development of commercial mechanical milling systems for finger millet is challenging.
Therefore the main product of finger millet is whole grain flour.
This has disadvantages such as reduced storage time of the flour due to the high oil content.
Furthermore the industrial use of whole grain finger millet flour is limited.
Recently a new milling system was developed in India which is able to grind finger millet grains.
This milling system is called Mini Millet Mill.
The Mini Millet Mill takes into account the traditional knowledge of the farmers and moistens the seeds half an hour before grinding.
Moistening the millet seeds prior to grinding helps to remove the bran mechanically without causing damage to the rest of the seed.
The mini millet mill can also be used to process other grains such as wheat and sorghum.
The Mini Millet Mill could be promising as it yields white flour which can be commercially used.216MaltingeditAnother method to process the finger millet grain is germinating the seed.
This process is also called malting process and is very common in the production of brewed beverages such as beer.
When finger millet is germinated enzymes are activated which transfer starches into other carbohydrates such as sugars.
Finger millet has a good malting activity.
The malted finger millet can be used as a substrate to produce for example glutenfree beer or easily digestible food for infants.2NutritioneditFinger millet is especially valuable as it contains the amino acid methionine which is lacking in the diets of hundreds of millions of the poor who live on starchy staples such as cassava plantain polished rice or maize meal.
Finger millet can be ground and cooked into cakes puddings or porridge.
The grain is made into a fermented drink or beer in Nepal and in many parts of Africa.
The straw from finger millet is used as animal fodder.
It is also used for a flavored drink in festivals.Nutritional value of finger millet per 100g 17Protein 7.6gFat 1.5gCarbohydrate 88gCalcium 370mgVitamins  A 0.48mgThiamine B1 0.33mgRiboflavin B2 0.11mgNiacin B3 1.2mgFiber 3g A merchant marketing finger millet powder nutrition food in Bengaluru Karnataka IndiaGrowing finger millet to improve nutritionedit Growing finger millet in Africa has been encouraged by some international development programs.The International Crops Research Institute for the SemiArid Tropics ICRISAT a member of the CGIAR consortium partners with farmers governments researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops including finger millet.
This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought.
For example the Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia HOPE project is increasing yields of finger millet in Tanzania by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties.
Finger millet is very high in calcium rich in iron and fibre and has a better energy content than other cereals.
These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.18Preparation as foodedit A grocery shop selling ragi in Tamil Nadu Finger millet in its commonly consumed form as a porridgeIn Indiaedit Ragi mudde and bhajji with sambar and chutneyIn India finger millet locally called by various names including Ragi Kannada  Telugu  Kezhvaragu Tamil  Nachani Marathi  Mandua Hindi  Mandia Odia  Same Bonda  is mostly grown and consumed in Karnataka Rajasthan19 Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu20 Odisha Maharashtra Goa21 Uttarakhand Garhwal and Kumaon districts and Gujarat Dang district 22The finger millet is malted and its grain are grinded to form flour.
The flour is consumed mixed with milk boiled water or yogurt.
The flour is made into flatbreads including thin leavened dosa and thicker unleavened roti.There are various food recipes of finger millet including dosa idli laddu etc.
In southern India on pediatricians recommendation finger millet is used in preparing baby food because of millets high nutritional content especially iron and calcium.
Homemade finger millet malt is considered to be very good for health.Konkan Region and Goaedit Pappad made of finger millet Eleusine coracana in GujaratFinger millet ragi is very popular and satva pole dosa bhakri ambil a sour porridge Pappad are very common preparations.
Nachani Ladus are common in some families.MaharashtraeditIn Maharashtra bhakri  in Marathi a type of flat bread is prepared using finger millet ragi flour.
In Mumbai and Navi Mumbai areas the biscuits prepared with ragi flour are also available in some bakeries.
They are getting popular because of their relatively lower calorific value and more fibre as compared to wheat.KarnatakaeditIn Karnataka finger millet ragi is generally consumed in the form of ragi mudde balls   ragi mudde in Kannada.
It is the staple diet of many residents of South Karnataka especially in the rural areas.
Mudde is prepared by cooking the ragi flour with water to achieve a doughlike consistency.
This is then rolled into balls of desired size and consumed with huli sambar Saaru or curries.
Mudde is cut into biteable sizes using fingers dipped in the curry preparation and swallowed wholly without biting into the pieces.
Ragi is also used to make roti idli dosa and conjee.
In the malnad region of Karnataka the whole ragi grain is soaked and the milk is extracted to make a dessert known as Keelsa.A type of flat bread is prepared using finger millet ragi flour called   ragi rotti in Kannada in Northern districts of Karnataka.Tamil NadueditIn Tamil Nadu ragi is called kezhvaragu  or just keppai .
Ragi is dried powdered and boiled to form a thick mass that is allowed to cool.
This is the famed kali or keppai kali.
This is made into large balls to quantify the intake.
It is taken with sambar or thick spicy lentil soups flavored with tamarind extracts.
For children ragi is also fed with milk and sugar malt.
It is also made in the form of pancakes with chopped onions and tomatoes.
Kezhvaragu is used to make puttu with jaggerysugar and adai by making a thick paste sweet or salt is used and tapping it flat on a hot skillet.
Apart from that ragi has its medicinal uses for sinus and severe cold by applying boiled kezhvaragu flour cooled to skin bearable warmth on the forehead.Ragi is considered to be the holy deity  food of Amman otherwise known as Goddess Kali.
Every small or large festival of this goddess is celebrated with women making ragi porridge in the temples and distributing it to the poor and needy.
This porridge is called Koozh  a staple diet in farming communities eaten along with raw onions  green chillies.TelanganaeditIn Telangana state finger millet malt called ambali  is consumed in morning as breakfast.Andhra PradesheditIn Andhra Pradesh ragi sankati or ragi muddha   in Telugu  ragi balls  are eaten in the morning with a chilli onions sambar dish.KeralaeditIn Kerala putu a traditional breakfast dish is usually made with rice powder with grated coconut and steamed in a cylindrical steamer.
The preparation is also made with ragi powder which is more nutritive.Central  Northern IndiaeditIn the tribal and western hilly regions of Odisha ragi or  mandiaa is a staple food.
The porridge and pitha made of ragi are more popular among village folk.In the Garhwal and Kumaon region of Uttarakhand koda   or maddua  is made into thick rotis served with ghee and also made as a dish   badi   similar to halwa but without sugar.
In the Kumaon region of northern India ragi is traditionally fed to women after child birth.
In some parts of Kumaon region the ragi flour is used to make various snacks like Namkeen Sev and Mathri.In South and Far East AsiaeditIn Nepaledit Roti made from Eleusine coracanaIn Nepal a thick dough ho  made of millet flour kd  is cooked and eaten by hand.
The dough on other hand can be made into thick bread rotee  spread over flat utensil and heating it.
Fermented millet is used to make a beer chhaang and the mash is distilled to make a liquor raki .
Whole grain millet is fermented to make tongba.
Its use in holy Hindu practices is barred especially by upper castes.In Sri LankaeditIn Sri Lanka finger millet is called kurakkan and is made into kurakkan roti  an earthy brown thick roti with coconut and thallapa  a thick dough made of ragi by boiling it with water and some salt until like a dough ball.
It is then eaten with a very spicy meat curry and is usually swallowed in small balls rather than chewing.
It is also eaten as a soup kurrakan kenda and as a sweet called Halape.In VietnameditIn northwest Vietnam finger millet is used as a medicine for women at childbirth.
A minority use finger millet flour to make alcohol bacha alcohol is a good drink of the Hmong minority.As beverageeditRagi malt porridge is made from finger millet which is soaked and shadow dried then roasted and ground.
This preparation is boiled in water and given to children patients adults etc.
This is a good substitute for milk powderbased beverages.Common names for finger milleteditArabic tailabon Chinese  Traditional  Simplified cnzi pinyin also  and  TraditionalDanish FingerhirseDhivehi   BinbiEnglish  Finger millet African millet Koracan Natcheny RagiEthiopia dagussa Amharic tokuso Soddo barankiya OromoFrench eleusine cultivee coracan koracanGerman FingerhirseIndiaAssamese    maruba dhanGujarati  bavato  naachni  nagaliHindi  maduamarua   mandua  maruwamaduwa  mandwa   ragiKannada  ragi Kumaon madduaGarhwal    koda  choonaKonkani  naanchani   nasnenachneMaithili Bihar especially in Mithila region madua Malayalam  ragimutharykuvarakukurumbullupanjipulMarathi  naachani  naagaliOdia  mandiaHimachali  kodra Punjabi   mandalmandhulmundalRajasthani  naachni  ragiSanskrit  madhulika  mattakam  nrityakundalaTamil  aariyam  kezhvaragu  keppai  raagiTelugu  ragi chollu  tamidaluUrdu  mandwa  maruwa  ragiJapan   shikoku hie shikokubieKenya wimbi Swahili kal Dholuo ugimbi Kikuyu and Meru obori KisiiKorea  susuNepal  kodo  maruwaNigeria tamba HausaRwanda uburoSri Lanka  kurakkan SinhalaSudan tailabon Arabic ceyut BariTanzania Mbege Mwimbi Wimbi Ulezi SwahiliTibetan bras ma du lun gaUganda Bulo Akalo Kwon Kwon KalVietnam Hong mi Chi keZambia Kambale lupoko mawele majolothi amale buleZimbabwe Rapoko zviyo njera rukweza mazhovole uphoko pohoSomalia Haruur Masago YocobGalleryeditFields of finger millet in the Annapurna region of NepalFinger millet sprays in UgandaMulticolored finger millet grainsFresh ragiReferencesedit The Plant List A Working List of All Plant Species.

Before the 1950s whole grains such as barley brown rice amaranth and ragi were staples in our traditional diet after which rice took over completely.
A whole grain is one which contains all three parts of the kernel  the bran germ and endosperm while refined grains are processed to retain only the endosperm.
This makes whole grains healthier as they contain the fiberdense bran and along with other essential nutrients that are not lost due to processing.
Ragi is one such super grain that has recently made a comeback.
It is a hardy crop that can grow in high altitudes and withstand harsh weather conditions making it perfectly suited for the Indian climatic conditions.
Popularly known as Finger Millet or Nachni in North India the grain actually originated in Africa and has been cultivated in Uganda and Ethiopia since many years.Ragi flour is prepared by either crushing dried grains or spouting drying and then grinding them.
The good thing is that Ragi is a rich source ofgood carbohydrates and since it is too tiny to be polished or processed it is mostly consumed in its purest form.
Dr. Ritika Samaddar Dietitian at Max Hospital in New Delhi agrees Because of its high nutritional value Ragi can be placed at the pinnacle of food grains.
The cereal is glutenfree and highly suitable for those who are gluten or lactose intolerant.
Besides this it can easily become a part of your daily diet in the form of chappatis or as porridge for breakfast.
If you find it too dense mix it with wheat flour in the ratio of 73 and make breads or bake with it.
Some modern spins on finger millets include Ragi Cookies and Ragi Flakes Noodles that make for easytocook and healthy snacks.It wouldnt be an exaggeration to call Ragi the staple food of South India.Traditionally it has been especially valuable for containing the amino acid methionine which is lacking in the diets of hundreds of people who live on starchy staples such as cassava plantain polished rice or maize meal says Ashwin Rajagopalan Chennaibased Food Blogger.Also ReadCooking Tips 101 How to Use Ragi Flour Like Never BeforeIn Karnataka which is the leading producer of finger millet it is generally consumed in the form of Ragi Mudde balls prepared by cooking the Ragi Flour with water to achieve a doughlike consistency.
The steamed dish is best served with spicy meat gravies.
Another dish Ragi Kanji porridge is a commonly found as a healthy dish in the state of Tamil Nadu he adds.Despite many health benefits Ragi remains absent in our diets and we havent really embraced it.
Besides South Indian restaurants not many are willing to experiment with the grain.
This is probably due to its bland taste that many may not appreciate.
Seema Chandra Food Editor at NDTV Food suggests a simple trick to enhance its flavour Its nice to roast some Ragi before using it which gives it a great nutty flavour.
Ragi is all encompassing.
It takes on the flavour of the dish.
When baking with it you can use different types of sugars like brown sugar or palm sugar to give it a kick and enhance the taste.The brownish hue resembles like that of chocolate when cooked.
You can easily sneak it in muffins or evening snacks and your kids will never know.If you are unaware about the benefits of including Ragi in your diet we have reasons and expert advice for why you most certainly should.1.
Loaded with Calcium Ragi is one of the best nondairy sources of calcium when compared to any other grains.
According to the National Institute of Nutrition in India 100 grams of Ragi contains 344 mg calcium.
Calcium is critical for healthy bones and teeth and prevention of osteoporosis  a disease which weakens the bones.
It is extremely beneficial for growing kids and can be given in the form of Ragi Porridge recommends Bangalorebased Nutritionist Dr. Anju Sood.2.Helps in Controlling Diabetes The grains seed coat is abundant in polyphenols and dietary fibres as compared to rice maize or wheat.
The low glycemic index lessens food cravings and maintains the digestive pace consequently keeping blood sugar within the safe range.
It is best to add it to your morning meal or have it for lunch in order to keep your system on track the whole day says Dr. Sood.Also Read7 Gluten Free Grains You Should Know AboutThe low glycemic index maintains the digestive pace consequently keeping blood sugar within the safe range.3.Reverts Skin Ageing Ragi works wonders for maintaining young and youthful skin.
Vital amino acids like Methionine and Lysine present in it make the skin tissues less prone to wrinkles and sagging.
Dr. Sood explains Ragi is also one of the very few natural sources of Vitamin D which is mostly derived from sunlight.
Vitamin D is a carrier molecule for calcium which accounts for vitality.4.Battles Anemia Ragi is an excellent source of natural iron and thus a boon for anemic patients and also for those with low haemoglobin levels.
Once ragi is allowed to sprout the Vitamin C levels tend to increase and lead to easy absorption of iron into the bloodstream.
Dr. Sood tells us For the optimum absorption of iron you can consume it in the form of Ragi Dosa orRagi Balls with plenty of vegetables and a generous squeeze of lime or a bowl of tangy Sambar.5.Relaxes the BodyRegular consumption of Ragi is highly beneficial in dealing with conditions of anxiety depression and insomnia.The presence of antioxidants mainly Tryptophan and amino acids helps as they work as natural relaxants.
As per a study conducted by MedIndia in 2000 Ragi consumption is also useful for migraines.
What better way there is than to calm yourself down by munching on some healthy and crisp Ragi cookies6.
Helps in Weight LossThe high amount of dietary fibrecombine keeps the stomach full for a longer and prevents unwanted cravings.
This in turn leads to a minimised appetite and weight loss.
Ragi lowers your blood sugar levels in the body by activating insulin.
Like I said before it is best consumed in the morning to make the most of its qualities and keep you fullthrough the day says Dr. Sood.Also Read7 Best Ragi RecipesThe high amount of dietary fibre combine keeps the stomach full for a longer and prevents unwanted cravings.

Heres a look at the many health benefits of ragi plus six great recipes.Article Sep  7 2015     1September 17 is celebrated every year as National Nutrition Week in India.
Today lets take a look at an amazing super cereal that can help control diabetes cancer osteoporosis and lots more.A generation ago many Indians especially in the southern part of the country were familiar with ragi or finger millet Eleusine coracana L..
The once wellknown cereal is however totally absent in most peoples diets today.
This is quite surprising and unfortunate considering the nutritive and therapeutic value of finger millet for the human body.
Besides it is a very adaptable crop that is admirably suited to Indian climatic conditions making it doubly significant.
Lets take a look at a few of the benefits of finger millet and some delicious recipes for ragi laddus cookies and pakodasRagi A Brief HistoryFinger millet originated in Africa and has been cultivated for many thousands of years in Uganda and Ethiopia.
In India the crop was probably introduced 4000 years ago and has been found in archeological excavations in the Harappan Civilization.
Benefits of Ragi1 Ragi has high protein contentThe grains protein content is comparable to that of rice.
However some ragi varieties have shown double that level.
More importantly this protein content is quite unique.
The main protein fraction is eleusinin which has a high biological value meaning that it is easily incorporated into the body.
There are also significant quantities of tryptophan cystine methionine and total aromatic amino acids.
If that sounds too complicated all you need to know is that these are considered crucial to human health and that most cereals are deficient in these components.
This high protein content makes finger millet a very important factor in preventing malnutrition.
The cereal can be an especially good source of protein for vegetarians because of its methionine content that constitutes about 5 of the protein.2 Ragi is a rich source of mineralsRagi is also a very rich source of minerals.
It has been found to have between 530 times the calcium content found in other cereals.
It is also rich in phosphorus potassium and iron.
Calcium is of course an important component in maintaining bone density and health.
Thus finger millet would be a healthier alternative to overthecounter supplements especially for people who might be at risk of osteoporosis or low hemoglobin levels.The study The Lost Crops of Africa published by the United States National Academies sees finger millet as a potential super cereal and points out that the worlds attitude towards finger millet must be reversed.
Of all major cereals this crop is one of the most nutritious.
The study notes that people in Uganda and southern Sudan have healthy strapping physiques despite eating just one meal a day and attributes this to finger millet.3 Ragi controls diabetesThe rapid rise in the prevalence of diabetes has led to a great demand for foods containing complex carbohydrates with high dietary fiber levels and beneficial phytochemicals.
Phytochemicals are a varied group of chemical compounds derived from plants which are considered to be important factors in our capacity to combat disease.
All these components are usually found in the outer layer of the grain or the seed coat and so it is generally a good idea to consume whole grains.
Especially with finger millet the grains seed coat is richer in polyphenols as compared to grains such as barley rice maize and wheat.
For example it has 40 times the phenolic content of rice and 5 times that of wheat.
Among the millets it is comparable to foxtail millet and second only to kodo millet.
Initial studies have also shown that finger millet controls blood glucose levels and hyperglycemic and oxidative stress.
Finger millet has also shown promise in accelerating wound healing among diabetics.4 Ragi has antimicrobial propertiesFinger millet has been found to act against a number of bacteria including Bacillus cereus which causes food poisoning Salmonella sp.
which causes a typhoidlike fever and Staphylococcus aureus one of the primary causes of skin and soft tissue infections such as abscesses furuncles and cellulitis.5 Ragi has anticancer potentialFinger millet is also rich in antioxidants which have sort of become a byword in health books today.
Antioxidants prevent excessive oxidation how surprising which could otherwise cause cancer and ageing because of cell damage.
The phenolic acids flavonoids and tannins present in finger millet seed coats have very effective antioxidant properties.
In general it has been shown that people on milletbased diets have lower incidences of esophageal cancer than those on wheat or maizediets.6 Ragi keeps you youngAside from the phenolic content and antioxidants which are important factors in preventing ageing finger millet and kodo millet have specifically shown potential in inhibiting crosslinking of collagen.
Collagen crosslinking is the process by which crosslinks form between or within collagen molecules in tendons skin and even blood vessels.
Collagen is what gives tissues their elasticity and crosslinking reduces this ability leading to the stiffness commonly associated with age.7 Ragi reduces bad cholestrol prevents cardiovascular diseaseEmerging research has shown that finger millet has the potential to reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Technically speaking finger millet reduces concentrations of serum triglycerides and inhibits lipid oxidation and LDL cholesterol oxidation.
LDL Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol is what is termed bad cholesterol and is especially troublesome when oxidized.
Oxidized LDL inflames the arteries leading to arteriosclerosis and the risk of heart attack or strokes.
The State of Ragi Cultivation TodayConsidering all these benefits it is extremely surprising that in a world desperate for health foods and miracle cures most people have never heard of ragi.
In many places where it is grown it is looked upon as a poor persons crop or a famine food.
In the United States it is often used as birdseed Though it is in decline in Africa it is still an important crop in the eastern part of the continent especially among subsistence farmers.
But in India it is greatly neglected and fast disappearing.
For example according to the governments crop production statistics in 199899 about 2.7 million tons of finger millet were harvested from 1.8 million hectares.
Fastforward to 201314 and those numbers have fallen by 95.
Only 90000 tons were harvested from 99000 hectares.
This despite the fact that this is a very hardy crop that grows even in arid regions with minimal water.
Finger millet is also available in a range of varieties that can be grown in monsoonheavy regions to dry areas and in the Himalayas as well upto an altitude of 2300 meters.Hopefully there will be a turnaround in finger millets fortunes.
Take a look at the recipes below and if you enjoy them include more ragi in your diet.
That would be one miniscule step in the right direction.
